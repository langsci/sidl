This grammar of \PS\ began as a part of my PhD project at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, which I successfully completed in August 2013. To a large extent, its contents are the same as the final version of my dissertation (hosted by the \href{http://macau.uni-kiel.de/receive/dissertation_diss_00013059}{university library in Kiel}), but a number of revisions and improvements to content and structure have been made, thanks mainly to many useful comments from anonymous reviewers, editors and proof-readers, but also due to my own ever increasing understanding of the language. 

A number of individuals played a vital role in enabling the research for and the writing of this grammar. 

Above all, I am indebted to the \PS\ community in Arjeplog not only for graciously permitting me to document their fascinating language, but also for allowing me -- initially just a random but curious stranger -- to intrude into their lives. 
I would particularly like to thank Nils-Henrik Bengtsson, Inger and Sven Anders Fjällås, Anders-Erling Fjällås, Elsy Rankvist, Edgar Skaile\superS{†}\,and Dagny Skaile.

My PhD supervisor, Ulrike Mosel, agreed to the task of guiding me quite late in my PhD project leading up to this book, even after much of the data for the corpus had already been collected; she provided invaluable criticism and played an essential role in the development of this grammar. %\textendash\ \It{mataa kurusu!} %JW: ‘mataa kurusu’ is Teop for thank you very much, according to Teop lexical database. %, and keeping form and function separate, and meta-language
