This is a revised version of my doctoral dissertation \textit{Typology and evolution of adjective attribution marking in the languages of northern Eurasia}, which I defended at the University of Leipzig in January 2011 \citep{riesler2011a}. I am indebted to my family members, friends, project collaborators, data consultants, listeners, supporters, sources of inspiration, opponents an other people who helped me finishing my  original dissertation. 

I am very thankful to the series editors who accepted my manuscript for publication with this prestigious open-access publisher, the technical stuff at Language Science Press, proofreaders and other people spending their valuable time helping in the production of this book.
