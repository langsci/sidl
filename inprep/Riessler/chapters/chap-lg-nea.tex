%%%

The following chapter contains an overall survey of adjective attribution marking devices which occur in the languages of northern Eurasia. For each genealogical unit, both the prototypical and the known minor noun phrase type(s) will be characterized and illustrated with examples. A complete list of adjective attribution marking devices in over 200 single languages considered for the present survey is found in a table starting on page~\pageref{sample1} in the Appendix. The geographic spread of the different noun phrase types is shown on several maps starting on page~\pageref{WorldMap} in the Appendix.

Whereas most languages of the Eskimo-Aleut family are spoken on islands in the Bering Strait or on the \isi{North America}n continent, a few varieties of the Yupik subbranch of Eskimo can be localized to north-easternmost \isi{Siberia}. But only one of these languages, Central Siberian Yupik, is still spoken \citep[224]{salminen2007}.

In Central Siberian Yupik, only one adjective attribution marking device is attested:
%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item incorporation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Adjective incorporation in Central Siberian Yupik}
Items that correspond to property-denoting words in other languages (“adjectives”) are phonologically bound nominal roots in Central Siberian Yupik. Adjectival modification is thus expressed by means of polysynthetic morphology and can be characterized as adjective incorporation according to the ontology presented in Part~II (Typology).

\il{Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|(}
\section{Chukotko-Kamchatkan}
Although \citet{salminen2007} describes Chukotkan and Kamchatkan as two independent families, most scholars today agree that they are two branches of one family \citep[see also the comparative dictionary by][]{fortescue2005a}.

\il{Chukotkan languages|(}
\subsection{Chukotkan}
%%%
The Chukotkan branch (aka Chukchi-Koryak)\il{Chukchi-Koryak|see{Chukotkan languages}} of Chukotko-Kamchatkan consists of two sub-branches. The first branch, Chukchi, is represented by only one language, Chukchi proper. The second branch, Koryak-Alutor,\il{Koryak-Alutor languages} is represented by the two languages Alutor\il{Alutor} and Koryak\il{Koryak} proper. A third branch, Kerek,\il{Kerek languages} is probably extinct \citep[253]{salminen2007} and consequently not considered here.

Constituent order inside the noun phrase of Chukotkan languages is strictly head-final. Adjective attribution marking is also similar in all Chukotkan languages. Two types are attested:
%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item incorporation
\item head\hyp{}driven agreement.\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement}

Whereas adjective incorporation is the default and unmarked type of adjective attribution marking in Alutor and Chukchi, several descriptions of the Chukotkan languages mention that adjectives can also occur in an unbound form (for Alutor, see \citealt{nagayama2003}; for Chukchi, see \citealt[103–104, 421–429]{skorik1960} and \citealt[251]{comrie1981}). As unbound morphemes, adjectives take the stative marker \textit{n-} as well as agreement markers for person, number and case.

%%%

The number/person/case-agreement suffixes of adjectives as well as the suffixes which mark possessive inflection of nouns belong to one and the same paradigm. Consequently, one could also interpret the Alutor and Chukchi data as another instance of \isi{modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement} (as in \ili{Oroch}, described in \S\ref{ModheadAgr}). If so, the examples in \REF{chukchi alutor free adj} should be translated literally as ‘reindeer's whiteness’, ‘house's bigness’. An analysis avoiding syntactic dependency reversal between noun and adjective \citep[cf.][]{malchukov2000}, however, is preferred here for two reasons: the first reason is the constituent order inside the noun phrase. The assumed head shift to a modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement construction would violate the otherwise strictly head-final constituent order rule in Alutor and Chukchi. 

The other reason arguing against syntactic head shift between noun and adjective is that in order to use non-incorporating constructions as in the examples in \REF{chukchi alutor free adj}, the adjective is first transformed into a \isi{stative verb} by means of a verbalizing prefix (\textit{-n}, glossed as \textsc{stat} in example \ref{chukchi alutor free adj}).

The verbalizer together with the agreement affix is sometimes glossed as an adjectivizing\is{adjective derivation} circumfix (\textsc{adjz>-\dots-<adjz:agr}), for instance in Nagayama's (\citeyear{nagayama2003}) grammatical description of Alutor. The given noun phrase type should then perhaps be analyzed as attributive state marking (as in Russian,\il{Russian} see \S\S\ref{anti-constr agr}, \ref{russian synchr}). Unlike in Russian, however, the same agreement marking as in attributive constructions shows up on predicates as well.
%%%
\begin{exe}

	\textbf{\textsc{stat}-ə-young-}\textsc{1sg}\\
\glt	‘I'm young’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

Consequently, an analysis of adjective attribution marking in Alutor and Chukchi as belonging to the state-marking type is rejected.

The semantic difference between the two constructions, with adjective incorporation on the one hand and head\hyp{}driven agreement marking on the other hand, is not clear. Whereas adjective incorporation is often described as the main or even only possible type (for Chukchi, see \citealt[37, 101]{kampfe-etal1995}), \citet[288]{kibrik-etal2000} state that this type indicates the corresponding quality or property as referring to background information in Alutor.

The following example from Chukchi, on the other hand, indicates that the non-incorporated adjective is used in an emphasized construction. Sentence (\ref{chukchi free adj}) was elicited by Vladimir Nedjalkov\ia{Nedjalkov, Vladimir} \citep[cited as a personal communication in][330]{rijkhoff2002} in order to find examples of multiple modifiers in one noun phrase, which seems to be avoided by speakers of Chukchi. In sentence (\ref{chukchi inc adj}) with the incorporated adjective, the speaker simply left out the demonstrative when translating into Chukchi.

\citet[716]{bogoras1922} states that the circum-positioned marker of the unbound adjective “sometimes corresponds to the definite\is{species marking!definite} article or designates an object as referred to before.” The unbound adjective, on the other hand, can only occur in absolutive case which is inherently connected to semantic definiteness\is{species marking!definite} \citep[cf.][207, passim]{dunn1999}.

\subsection{Kamchatkan}
%%%
The only surviving member of the Kamchatkan branch is Itelmen (aka Western Kamchadal)\il{Western Kamchadal|see{Itelmen}} \citep[224]{salminen2007}.

The only attested type of adjective attribution marking in Itelmen is:\footnote{According to \citet{volodin1997}, a few adjectives (among them Russian\il{Russian} loan adjectives) occur in \isi{juxtaposition}.}
%%%
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
%%%

\paragraph*{Anti\hyp{}construct state agreement in Itelmen}
\label{itelmen synchr}
Constituent order inside the noun phrase of Itelmen is head-final. Adjectives form a class that is clearly syntactically distinguished from nouns: unlike the latter, adjectives are never represented by their root morphemes alone. Unlike verbs, which take TAM\is{TAM marking} markers, adjectives take adjectival morphology and are licensed either by an attributive or predicative\is{predicative marking} (adverbal) suffix (\citealt{volodin1997}; \citealt[54]{georg-etal1999}).

Since attributive adjectives also agree in case (though restricted to instrumental case), the noun phrase type can be characterized as anti\hyp{}construct state agreement, structurally similar to the type found in Russian.\il{Russian} Consider the following example.\footnote{Note that the shape of the state marking suffix \textit{-lan'ļ} ($\leftarrow$ \textit{-lah-ļ}) is the result of a regular morpho-phonological process \citep{georg-etal1999}.}

%%%
Nivkh (aka Gilyak)\il{Gilyak|see {Nivkh}} is an isolated language spoken in the far east of the Eurasian continent on Sakhalin Island in easternmost Russia \citep[222–223]{salminen2007}.

\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement|(}
The only type of adjective attribution marking attested in Nivkh is:
%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item head\hyp{}driven agreement.
\end{itemize}
%%%

\paragraph*{Head\hyp{}driven agreement in Nivkh}
Property words in Nivkh are verbal roots. As modifiers in noun phrases these adjectival verbs occur to the left of the head noun in a construction which is sometimes described as a polysynthetic structure (cf.~\citealt[16]{gruzdeva1998}; \citealt[80]{jakobson1971}, quoted by \citealt[138]{rijkhoff2002}). The reason for analyzing adjectives in Nivkh as being incorporated into the modified noun is the phonological boundedness of the constituents evidenced by regular alternations in the initial segments of the noun stem \citep[16]{gruzdeva1998}.
%%%
\begin{exe}
\ex {\rm Nivkh \citep[16]{gruzdeva1998}}

\ex tu ‘lake’
\ex 
\gll	pily-du\\
	be\_big-lake\\
\glt	‘big lake’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

In her sketch grammar of Nivkh, however, \citet{gruzdeva1998} writes adjectival words consistently as morphologically unbound words.\footnote{For instance \textit{čuz pitɣy-Ø} [new book-\textsc{nom}] (19), \textit{kyla n'iɣvn̦} [high man] (33), \textit{pila eri} [big river] (38).}

Interestingly, the phonological stem alternation rules also apply to the plural inflection of nouns and their adjectival attributes by means of reduplication.\is{reduplication} The reduplicated stem of the participle \textit{t'osk̦} in \REF{nivkh redup} ‘destroyed’ is therefore realized as \textit{-zosk̦}.

Note that number agreement of the attributive forms of adjectives by means of reduplication is archaic in Nivkh. According to Ekaterina Gruzdeva (p.c.),\ia{Gruzdeva, Ekaterina} attributive adjectives practically never reduplicate\is{reduplication} any more. Examples of reduplicating adjectives are, however, included in the older grammar by Panfilov (\citeyear{panfilov1965}).

%"isolate" is incorrect, cf. Ryukyuan languages etc.
The noun phrase structure in Japanese, an isolated language, is strictly head-final. Two types of adjective attribution marking devices are attested:
\begin{itemize}
%%%
\item juxtaposition
\item anti\hyp{}construct state marking.
\end{itemize}
%%%

\paragraph*{Juxtaposition in Japanese}
Two distinct lexical classes of words describe the state that an entity is in. Verbal adjectives belong to the first class. These adjectives are distinguished from \isi{stative verb}s by the adjectivizer\is{adjective derivation} suffix \textit{-i}. Used as predicates, the adjectivized verbs marked with \textit{-i} follow the noun but do not require any copula. Attributive adjectives, on the other hand, are juxtaposed to the left of the modified noun. 
%%%
\begin{exe}
\ex {\rm Verbal adjectives in Japanese \citep[170]{backhouse1984}}

\gll	\textbf{naga-i} rombun\\
	long-\textsc{adjz} article\\
\glt	‘long article’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

Since the adjectivizer\is{adjective derivation} suffix \textit{-i} simply marks \isi{stative verb} roots as (attributive and predicative) adjectives, it is not considered an attribution marking device. Hence, the class of verbal adjectives in Japanese is merely attributed by juxtaposition. Constituent order is crucial for differentiating attributive from predicative adjectives.\is{predicative marking}\footnote{Note that the description if the suffix \textit{-i} as an adjectivizer is simplified here. There is also overlap with \textsc{\isi{tense} marking}, cf.~\textit{rombun-wa naga-i} [\textsc{prs}] ‘the article is long’ versus \textit{rombun-wa naga‑kat-ta} [\textsc{pst}] ‘the article was long’.}
\is{juxtaposition|)}

\paragraph*{Anti\hyp{}construct state in Japanese}
Unlike “verbal adjectives”, which were described in the previous section, the few members of the second adjectival sub-class, i.e., “nominal adjectives” require a special attributive form marked by the invariable attributive suffix \textit{-na}.
%%%
\begin{exe}

%%%

Note that the word class boundary between nominal adjectives and nouns in Japanese is not always clear because some words take either the noun attribution marker \textit{-no} (\ref{japan na}) or the adjective attribution marker \textit{-na} (\ref{japan no}) when modifying a noun. The arbitrary behavior of attribution marking of nouns and nominal adjectives in Japanese indicates the continuous nature of these two word classes in this language \citep[79–80]{pustet1989}.

\citet[82]{zevachina2001} labels the function of the marker as an “emphasizing\hyp{}predicative”. But looking at her other examples it becomes obvious that \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} does not mark predicative adjectives but rather nominalized attributive adjectives.

Attributive marking with the suffix \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} in Dungan needs to be investigated in more detail, especially in connection to constituent order. The head-initial structure seems to be used in order to emphasize the property denoted by the adjective.

However, according to the descriptions of Dungan taken into account here (i.e., \citealt{kalimov1968} and \citealt{zevachina2001}), the language exhibits two adjective attribution marking devices: \isi{juxtaposition} and attributive nominalization by means of the article \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}}. While juxtaposition (with the order adjective-noun) seems to be the unmarked type, attributive nominalization is restricted to certain pragmatically marked constructions.

%Mongolic-nördliches China: Dagurisch, Mongorisch, Bao'an, Donxiang, Oirat
The Mongolic language family consists of five branches (cf.~\citealt[222]{salminen2007}). The core branch, Mongolian, includes the languages Kalmyk,\il{Kalmyk} Khalkha,\il{Khalkha} Khamnigan Mongol,\il{Khamnigan Mongol} and Oyrat\il{Oyrat} (aka Oirat).\il{Oirat|see{Oyrat}} Kalmyk is spoken in easternmost \isi{Europe} (in the Republic of Kalmykia of the Russian Federation). The other Mongolian languages are all spoken in \isi{Inner Asia}, along with Dagur\il{Dagur} which belongs to a satellite branch of the Mongolic family. Languages of the remaining three satellite branches of Mongolic are not considered here since they are all spoken outside the northern Eurasian area.

\is{juxtaposition|(}
With regard to their principal noun phrase structure, all Mongolic languages of northern Eurasia exhibit the inherited \ili{Proto\hyp{}Mongolic} features, including strictly head-final constituent order and juxtaposition of attributive adjectives (“adjectival nouns”) as the only attribution marking device.

Note, however, that adjectives in Mongolic languages do not differ formally from regular nouns but are distinguishable from the latter only by their syntactic behavior and specific derivational patterns (cf.~\citealt[10]{janhunen2003b} for Proto\hyp{}Mongolic\il{Proto\hyp{}Mongolic} and \citealt[161]{svantesson2003} for Khalkha).\il{Khalkha}\footnote{In the two Mongolic languages \ili{Moghol} (spoken in Afghanistan) and Mangghuer\il{Mangghuer} (spoken in China) there is a distinct class of adjectives (cf.~\citealt[252]{weiers2003} for Moghol and \citealt[311]{slater2003} for Mangghuer). However, these languages are not considered since they are spoken outside the northern Eurasian area.}

The Tungusic language family (aka Manchu-Tungus)\il{Manchu-Tungus languages|see{Tungusic languages}} comprises several single languages belonging to the three branches North Tungusic, Amur Tungusic and Manchu, all spoken in southern \isi{Siberia} (Russia), northern Mongolia and northern China.

The constituent order inside the noun phrase in all Tungusic languages is relatively strictly head-final. In several Tungusic languages, attributive adjectives (“adjectival nouns”) are simply juxtaposed with the modified noun. This type is also mentioned as being prototypical of adjective attribution marking devices in Tungusic languages (e.g., \citealt{sunik1968a}; \citealt[133]{kormusin2005}). However, several other types occur as well. The following adjective attribution marking devices are attested in Tungusic:

Languages belonging to the northern branch of Tungusic are Even (aka Lamut), Evenki (aka Oroqen in China), Negidal and Solon (aka Ewenke in China).

\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement|(}
The major North Tungusic languages, Even and Evenki, deviate from the Tungusic prototype and exhibit head\hyp{}driven agreement as their general type (\citealt[11]{malchukov1995}; \citealt[18]{bulatova-etal1999}). Attributive nominalization and modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement occur in these two languages as well, even though these devices are restricted to specially marked noun phrase types.

\il{Even|(}
\paragraph*{Head\hyp{}driven agreement in Even}
According to \citet[20]{malchukov1995}, the occurrence of head\hyp{}driven agreement marking of adjectives in Even is determined by discourse-pragmatic factors: attributes in the rhematic (focus) position always agree with their heads, whereas agreement is optional in non-focus positions \citep[31–32]{malchukov1995}.\footnote{According to \citet[31]{malchukov1995}, regular head\hyp{}driven agreement occurs as the default type of adjective attribution marking only in literary Even and hence in prescriptive grammars. This does not reflect, however, the actual language use.}

\citet[30–31]{malchukov1995} describes the attributive agreement patterns in Even in a hierarchical way: the adjective modifier can agree in all morphological features of the head-noun (\ref{even agr}) or just in number (\ref{even numagr}). Juxtaposition is also possible but restricted to adjectives in non-focus position (\ref{even juxt}).

\is{attributive nominalization|(}
\paragraph*{Attributive nominalization in Even (I)}
The “attribute raising agreement” illustrated in the previous section (\S\ref{even raising}) can be extended with a fourth step, specifically with adjective attributes marked by the “restrictive” (i.e., \isi{contrastive focus}) marker \textit{=takan/=teken} (here glossed as a nominalizer).

\end{exe}
%%%

Attributes marked as “restrictive” obligatorily agree with the head noun \citep[32]{malchukov1995}. Noun phrases marked by means of \textit{=takan / =teken} thus resemble the attributive nominalization type, i.e., the attribute is marked as a syntactically complex constituent (i.e., as an embedded complement to the head noun) by means of nominalization.

\paragraph*{Attributive nominalization in Even (II)}
A second attributive nominalization strategy by means of the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular (in “determinative”\is{species marking!definite} function; here glossed as a nominalizer) is attested in an investigation of the non-possessive use of the possessive marker in different Turkic and Tungusic languages \citep{benzing1993b}.

According to \citet[17–18 Footnote 58]{benzing1993b}, the “determinative”\is{species marking!definite} suffix \textit{-n} ($\Leftarrow$ \textsc{poss:3sg}) can be used as a marker of contrastive focus in Even.

\il{Evenki|(}
\is{modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement|(}
\paragraph*{Modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement in Evenki}
Evenki follows the general Tungusic rule of head-final constituent ordering inside the noun phrase. In constructions emphasizing the property denoted by the attributive adjectives, however, the unmarked adjective-noun order can be reversed. In these constructions, the adjective is obligatorily equipped with the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person (singular or plural).
%%%

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

According to \citet[18]{bulatova-etal1999}, the phrase final adjective ‘good’ marked with the possessive suffix is used as a true possessive noun in \REF{evenki poss} and they translate the example like this: ‘I know the man's goodness’. This construction, however, is similar to the modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement described for \ili{Oroch} (\ref{oroch modhead}) and Udege\il{Udege} (\citealt[485, passim]{nikolaeva-etal2001}).\footnote{Similar modifier\hyp{}headed constructions are found in Even where modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement is in fact attested, cf.~\textit{Asatkan \textbf{nood-do-n} haaram.} [girl beautiful-\textsc{acc}-\textsc{poss:3sg} I\_know] \citep[11]{malchukov1995}. But unlike similar modifier\hyp{}headed participles (in possessor agreement constructions) in Even \citep[31]{malchukov1995} and similar modifier\hyp{}headed adjectives in Oroch (\citealt{malchukov2000}, cf.~also example \ref{oroch modhead}) Malchukov translates this example as a true possessive construction with a nominal attribute: ‘I know the girl's beauty’ (but not: ‘I know the beautiful girl’).}

Whereas \isi{juxtaposition} is the default type of adjective attribution marking in Oroch, modifier\hyp{}headed possessor agreement occurs only in a special noun phra\-se type where the adjective is marked for contrastive focus. The special function marked by this construction is to focus on the property denoted by the adjective: ‘a man, a property of whom is “to be good”’ \citep[3]{malchukov2000}. This noun phrase type thus resembles the function of relative clause\is{adnominal modifier!relative clause} formation.\footnote{Note also that a similar construction is found in Even\il{Even} from the Northern Tungusic branch where it is only attested with participles: \textit{Beji-l-bu \textbf{hör-če-wut-ten} emu-re-m.} [man-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{acc} go-\textsc{pfct.ptcp}-\textsc{acc}-\textsc{poss:3pl} bring-\textsc{nonfut}-\textsc{1sg}] ‘I brought back the men who had left’ \citep[31]{malchukov1995}.}

Noun phrases show strictly head-final constituent order in both Yukaghir languages. True adjective attribution scarcely exists because modifying “property words” in noun phrases are best coded as relative clauses.\is{adnominal modifier!relative clause}
%Martin: But (77) from Korean and (79a) from Dungan are also rel. clauses\\Micha: but there is no special attr-marking here

\paragraph*{Juxtaposition in Kolyma Yukaghir}
There is no large class of lexical adjectives in Yukaghir. The only true adjectives in both Yukaghir languages belong to two semantic pairs: ‘small’ versus ’big’ and ‘old, ancient’ versus ‘new, fresh; (an)other’. The use of adjectives from the first pair is even restricted to a few lexicalized expressions \citep[70–71]{maslova2003b}. It is hard to categorize these adjectives according to their morpho-syntax. \citet[71]{maslova2003b} glosses the lexicalized expressions with the adjectives ‘small’ and ‘big’ as compounds, like in \textit{čom+parnā} [big+crow] ‘raven’. The adjective ‘new’, on the other hand can not only be used in such compounds but can even be marked additionally by the noun attribution suffix \textit{-d} or by the action nominal suffix \textit{-l} \citep[71]{maslova2003b}.

\paragraph*{Anti\hyp{}construct state in Kolyma Yukaghir}
With the exception of the very small closed class described in the previous section, there are no adjectives in Kolyma Yukaghir (\citealt[79–112]{krejnovic1982}; \citealt[66–69, 145–147]{maslova2003b}). All other words denoting qualities constitute a subclass of verbs. Used as attributes, these \isi{stative verb}s take the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular intransitive suffix \mbox{\textit{-j(e)}}.\footnote{Note that this morpheme takes different phonological shapes as the result of allomorphic alternations.} The inflected finite verbs, as in \REF{yuk attr}, are described as “special attributive forms” by \citet[66, passim]{maslova2003b}.

Since verbs take different inflectional suffixes depending on their use as predicates or attributes (i.e., relative clauses, cf.~\ref{yuk attr}, \ref{yuk pred}) the suffix \textit{-j(e)} glossed as \textsc{attr:intr.3sg} can only be analyzed as an anti\hyp{}construct state marker, i.e., it constitutes a dependent\hyp{}marking attribution device which is not connected to noun phrase internal agreement. Even though the marker belongs to the verbal inflection paradigm it is a true licenser of the attributive relationship between a modifying verb phrase (relative clause)\is{adnominal modifier!relative clause} and a noun.

Anti\hyp{}construct state marking in Kolyma Yukaghir does not, however, belong to the domain of true adjective attribution marking but is a relative clause\is{adnominal modifier!relative clause} marking strategy.\footnote{In order to use a verb as modifier inside a noun phrase, the verb can also be nominalized, for example by means of an action nominal marker: \textit{kel-u-l} [come-0-\textsc{nmlz} ‘(a situation of) coming’ \citep[147]{maslova2003b}, \textit{kel-u-l šoromo} [come-0-\textsc{nmlz} person] ‘(a/the) man who came (i.e., (a/the) already arrived man)’ \citep[67]{maslova2003b}. This derivational nominalization of verbs to nominals is not considered to constitute an adjective attribution marking device either.}
\il{Kolyma Yukaghir|)}

\il{Tundra Yukaghir|(}
\paragraph*{Anti\hyp{}construct state in Tundra Yukaghir}
Tundra Yukaghir exhibits an anti\hyp{}construct state marking device of verbs using a relative clause\is{adnominal modifier!relative clause} marking strategy similar to Kolyma Yukaghir\il{Kolyma Yukaghir} \citep[49–50, passim]{maslova2003a}. In her short grammar, \citet{maslova2003a} mentions the occurrence of a second anti\hyp{}construct state marking device and gives the following example:

\begin{exe}

\glt	‘very old woman’

%%%

The use of the marker \textit{-d} is not obligatory and is even restricted to head nouns with vowel-initial stems \citep[50]{maslova2003a}.

Interestingly, the second attribution marking device in Tundra Yukaghir is polyfunctional and regularly serves the licensing of single nouns (\ref{yuk nounattr}) as well as complex noun phrases\is{adnominal modifier!noun} (\ref{yuk npattr}) as attributes.

\paragraph*{Juxtaposition and head\hyp{}driven agreement in Ket}
Attributive adjectives in Ket are normally juxtaposed to the left of the noun they modify \citep[38]{vajda2004}. Only a few simple adjective stems describing visible shapes or sizes may optionally take the plural suffix \textit{-ŋ}, as shown in \REF{ket agr}. The other morphological features assigned to the noun phrase, i.e., gender (or class) and case, are not sensitive to syntax in Ket.

\citet[38]{vajda2004} notes that the optional number agreement marking is “a stylistic device used to emphasize the visual impression created by the quality being described”. This emphasizing construction probably marks \isi{contrastive focus} of the adjective: ‘big tents’ versus ‘\textsc{big} tents’.

\citet[15, 84–85]{vajda2004} also mentions the nominalizing suffix \textsc{-s} which marks lexical and derived adjectives (\ref{ket adjn nmlz}), noun phrases\is{adnominal modifier!noun} (\ref{ket np nmlz}), and adposition phrases\is{adnominal modifier!adposition phrase} (\ref{ket ap nmlz}) as adnominal modifiers in \isi{headless noun phrase}s.\footnote{Note that the examples (\ref{ket np nmlz} and \ref{ket ap nmlz}) seem to represent phonological compounds. This is evidenced by the phonological reduction in syllable-mediate vowels. The non-nominalized phrases, according to \citet{vajda2005} are \textit{úgda ɔ́lin} ‘a long nose’ and \textit{qō-t-hɯtɯ-ɣa} ‘under the ice [ice-\textsc{gen}-under]’. It is not clear from the description, however, if incorporation is relevant to morpho-syntax as well. But this phenomenon deserves further attention since adjective incorporation is scarcely attested in the world's languages but occurs in a few other non-related branches of the northern Eurasia.}

The available data does not provide enough evidence for a detailed description and analyses of attributive nominalization by means of the suffix \textit{-s} as a regular attribution marking device in Ket. It it possible that these nominalizations cannot be used as true modifiers of nouns but are restricted to \isi{headless noun phrase}s and are used only in special \isi{contrastive focus} constructions.

There is even evidence against the analysis of nominalization as attributive marking in Ket. Vajda's examples of nominalized adverbials suggest that this contrastive focus marking is used predominantly in copular constructions (as predicates). Since the otherwise regular predicative agreement marking\is{predicative marking} never occurs on these nominalizations \citep[15]{vajda2004} it could also be argued that the nominalizer \textit{-s} constitutes a strategy for secondary predication marking rather than attribution marking.

Attributive nominalization in Ket definitely deserves more attention. The construction might constitute an example of the development of attributive nominalization independent of definiteness marking.\is{species marking!definite}

\section{Turkic}
%%%
Languages from the Turkic language family are spoken across all of northern Eurasia, including northeastern and southeastern \isi{Europe}, and beyond. The family is divided into two major branches: Bulgar and Common Turkic. Whereas Bulgar Turkic\il{Bulgar Turkic languages} is represented only by one language, the Common Turkic\il{Common Turkic languages} branch can be further divided into nine groups. Seven of these groups have members spoken in northern Eurasia: Oguz,\il{Oguz languages} Karluk,\il{Karluk languages} Kipchak,\il{Kipchak languages} Altay Turkic,\il{Altay Turkic languages} Yenisey Turkic\il{Yenisey Turkic languages} (Khakas),\il{Khakas|see{Yenisey Turkic languages}} Sayan Turkic,\il{Sayan Turkic languages} and Lena Turkic\il{Lena Turkic languages} \citep[221]{salminen2007}.

\is{juxtaposition|(}
All Turkic languages are characterized by strict head-finality in their noun phrase structure. The prototypical adjective attribution marking device in Turkic languages is juxtaposition. This type occurs as the unmarked construction in all Turkic languages. In some Turkic languages, however, an attributive nominalizer marks an attributive adjective in \isi{contrastive focus} constructions. This construction is systematically described (more or less) only for Chuvash\il{Chuvash} from the Bulgar Turkic branch.

The following types of adjective attribution marking are attested:

Abkhaz attributive adjectives  show agreement in number.\footnote{Noun phrases with an attributive adjective following a non-inflected noun in Abkhaz have alternatively been analyzed as polysynthetic constructions (hence adjective incorporation), e.g., by \citet[123]{rijkhoff2002} and \citet{gil2005}.} Note, however, that a plural noun modified by an adjective may remain unmarked \citep[46]{hewitt1989a}. Even though the plural marker may attach only once at the right phrase edge, it is best analyzed as an agreement marker and not a \isi{clitic}. This is evidenced by the fact that the adjective may take the non-human pluralizer even if it modifies a human noun.\footnote{Note that in the closely related language Abaza, plural marking occurs twice but the non-human pluralizer constitutes the obligatory plural agreement marker on adjectives modifying nouns of any gender class \citep[100]{lomtatidze-etal1989}.}

In the head-final noun phrase type, on the other hand, the modern Kartvelian languages display a strong tendency to lose head\hyp{}driven agreement. Preposed attributive adjectives in \ili{Mingrelian} and \ili{Laz} are juxtaposed to the head noun as a rule.

Appositional modification seems to occur as a secondary type of adjective attribution marking in Georgian. Attributive adjectives are normally preposed and show only limited agreement (\ref{georgian unmarked}). In postposition (marking emphasis), however, the adjective inflects for the full set of cases and numbers (\ref{georgian marked}). This construction thus resembles an independent (headless) noun phrase\is{headless noun phrase} in apposition to the semantic head \citep[652, 677]{testelec1998}.

Neo-Aramaic (aka Modern Aramaic) is the only language of the northwestern branch of Semitic considered in the present survey. It is spoken in the Middle-East in north-western Iran, Iraq and south-eastern Turkey, but also in adjacent areas of the Caucasus\is{Caucasus} in Azerbaijan, and therefore falls into the geographic area of investigation.

\paragraph*{Head\hyp{}driven agreement in Neo-Aramaic}
Constituent order inside the noun phrase of Neo-Aramaic is noun-adjective. Attributive adjectives agree with the modified noun in gender and number.

The Uralic language family comprises the branches (roughly from West to East) Hungarian,\il{Hungarian} Saamic,\il{Saamic languages} Finnic,\il{Finnic languages} Permic,\il{Permic languages} Mari,\il{Mari languages} Mordvin,\il{Mordvin languages} Khanty,\il{Khanty languages} Mansi,\il{Mansi languages} and Samoyedic\il{Samoyedic languages} \citep[216–218]{salminen2007}. Except for most languages from the Samoyedic subbranch of the family, Uralic languages are all spoken in \isi{Europe}. Uralic is thus one of the major families on the European linguistic map.

The constituent order inside the noun phrase is strictly adjective-initial in all Uralic languages. Similar to Mongolic,\il{Mongolic languages} Turkic\il{Turkic languages} and many other languages of \isi{North Asia}, the prototypical adjective attribution marking device in Uralic languages is \isi{juxtaposition}. This type occurs as the unmarked construction in most Uralic languages with the exception of the two western branches Saamic\il{Saamic languages} and Finnic\il{Finnic languages} as well as in \ili{Nganasan} from the Samoyedic\il{Samoyedic languages} branch, which have abandoned juxtaposition and developed new types.

Secondary adjective attribution marking devices are also attested in languages of the Permic\il{Permic languages} and Mari\il{Mari languages} (and probably also other) branches of Uralic, even though juxtaposition is used in these languages as the default strategy for adjective attribution marking.

The following five adjective attribution marking devices occur in Uralic:

Attributive adjectives in Tundra Nenets are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets\il{Forest Enets} and (\ref{hung juxt}) from \ili{Hungarian}. However, it has been noticed in descriptions of Tundra Nenets that optional head\hyp{}driven agreement is possible under certain pragmatic conditions (cf., e.g., \citealt[50, passim]{jalava2013a}; \citealt[151–152, passim]{nikolaeva2014a}; \citealt[544]{salminen1998a}). (\ref{t nenets agr}) is an example where number agreement indicates “some kind of definiteness or concreteness, as opposed to the generic interpretation of the plural NP” \citep[152]{nikolaeva2014a}.

Siegl's note that “under certain pragmatic functions, apparently definiteness, a kind of number agreement (though not in the dual) seems to be possible” \citep[177]{siegl2013a} indicates that \ili{Forest Enets} behaves similar to Tundra Nenets.

Examples (\ref{attr demnmlz}–\ref{attr npnmlz}) show that attributive nominalization in Udmurt is a true attribution marking device which is polyfunctional and not restricted to \isi{headless noun phrase}s.

\is{species marking!definite|(}
\is{contrastive focus|(}
Note that the attributive article is normally labeled “determinative suffix” (or in similar terms) in the Udmurt (and Uralic) grammatical tradition. This label probably originates from the formative's function as a quasi-definite marker. But “determinative” inflection is obligatory only in the case of differential object marking with the marked versus the unmarked accusative. Note also that the definite-marked accusative suffix, again, is historically identical with the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person possessive suffix.

\glt	‘I have read the (i.e., ‘this certain’) book.’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

Note also that in these and similar examples, the concept of definiteness does not always coincide with the use of the differential “in\slash{}definite accusative” marking. According to \citet[21]{winkler2001}, “the marked accusative is used if the object itself is focused, whereas the unmarked is employed if the action itself bears the logical accent.” Accordingly, even such occurrences of the “determinative suffix” thus resemble focus marking rather than definiteness marking.

Even though contrastive focus inflection of nouns (or noun phrases) would be the result of purely morphological (morpho-semantic) assignment, contrastive focus inflection of adnominal adjectives can only be analyzed as a morpho\hyp{}syntactic feature assigned noun phrase internally. This is evidenced by the agreement pattern: whereas adjectives in non-contrasted (unmarked) constructions are simply juxtaposed to the head noun, contrastive focused adjectives normally show head\hyp{}driven number agreement.\footnote{The different order of morphemes in certain members of contrastive focus inflection paradigms (i.e., number-, case-, and (former) possessive suffix) as compared to the historically similar “regular” possessive inflection \citep[32]{winkler2001} is not of concern here. This phenomenon does, however, provide evidence for the analysis of the contrastive focus marker of adjectives and the possessive marker of nouns as two different formatives from a synchronic point of view.} Agreement marking on the adjective is clearly assigned by syntax, the head noun being the agreement trigger and the attributive adjective (in contrastive focus) being the agreement target.

Attributive marking in contrastive focus constructions in Udmurt (and the other Permic languages) is similar in theory to prototypical anti\hyp{}construct state agreement marking in languages like Russian,\il{Russian} with regard to both synchrony and diachrony. The construction is still analyzed as attributive nominalization because the agreement marking on the nominalized attribute is the indirect result of the attributive appositional construction and the nominalizing and agreement formatives are not fused synchronically.

According to \citet[63]{csucs1990}, \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement} marking in constructions without the “determinative suffix” is the result of analogy.

Saamic languages are spoken on the Scandinavian peninsula in north-central Norway and Sweden as well as in northern Finland and on the Kola peninsula in northwesternmost Russia. Saamic branches further into an eastern and a western subgroup.

The Saamic languages are exceptional among Uralic and the languages of most other families of \isi{Europe} in that they exhibit special attributive marking of adjectives, prototypically expressed by an invariable attributive suffix. In \S\ref{dep-marking state} of Part~II (Typology), this noun phrase type was characterized as \textit{dependent\hyp{}marked attributive state}; the corresponding formative is labeled \textit{anti\hyp{}construct state marker}. Note, however that the regular use of this inflectional category of adjectives and the relevant formatives vary considerably across the different Saamic languages.

\il{Skolt Saami|(}
\paragraph*{Anti\hyp{}construct state in Skolt Saami}\hspace{0.4cm}
Prototypically, the anti\hyp{}construct state marking suffix in Saamic languages has the shape \textit{-(V)s \textasciitilde-(V)s'}.\footnote{The palatalized variant occurs in Ter Saami and Kildin Saami.} The suffix is found in all Saamic languages (\citealt{riesler2006b}; see also \S\ref{saamic diachr} where the origin of attributive state marking in Saamic is dealt with in detail). 

\is{predicative marking|(}
In Skolt Saami, the prototypical pairs of predicative and attributive adjective forms are equipped with the suffixes \textit{-(V)d} \textsc{pred} and \textit{-(V)s} \textsc{attr} respectively, although other suffix pairs occur as well \citep[173–176]{feist2015a}. Whereas the suffix \textit{-(V)d} in \REF{skolt pred} marks the predicative state of the adjective, the suffix \mbox{\textit{-(V)s}} is an attributive state marker. The examples (\ref{skolt attr}) show that the formative is invariable and does not alter its form in a plural or case marked noun phrase.

In all Saamic languages, attributive (and predicative) state marking of adjectives is complex and determined by certain lexically defined classes and subclasses of adjectives. Many adjectives are marked only for attributive state but show the unmarked stem form in the predicative form. Consider for instance \textit{neuʹrr} [\textsc{pred}] versus \textit{neeuʹr-es} [\textsc{attr}] ‘bad’, in Skolt Saami. In addition, in the predicative forms of several adjectives, suffixes other than \textit{-(V)d} also occur. Finally, there are a few adjectives which also use the attributive suffix in their predicative forms \citep[cf.][173–176]{feist2015a}.

In fact, a general tendency is noticeable in all Saamic languages: the differentiated morphological marking of predicative and attributive adjectives is being abolished in favor of using the pure or extended stem forms in both syntactic positions. As a result, attributive state marking seems to be in dissolution \citep{riesler2006b}. Several classes of adjectives, however, do not seem to be as affected by the functional spread of the \isi{juxtaposition}al type. In Skolt Saami, the anti\hyp{}construct state marker is even used productively in several derived adjective classes, such as with the abessive adjectivizer.\is{adjective derivation}

\paragraph*{Juxtaposition in Skolt Saami}
Whereas dependent\hyp{}marked attributive state is the prototypical type of adjective attribution marking in Skolt (as well as in the other Saamic languages), certain adjectives are never inflected in their attributive form, one instance being \textit{nuõrr} ‘young’ \citep[cf.~also][176]{feist2015a}.

The noun phrase type in which ‘young’ and other members of this adjectival class occur must be characterized as {juxtaposition}. Hence, Skolt Saami exhibits a second, minor adjective attribution marking device in addition to attributive state marking.

\subsubsection{West Saamic}
The five West Saamic languages are Northern,\il{Northern Saami} Lule,\il{Lule Saami} Pite,\il{Pite Saami} Ume\il{Ume Saami} and \ili{Southern Saami}. They are spoken in northern Norway and Sweden and in the adjacent parts of northern Finland.

\il{Northern Saami|(}
\il{Pite Saami|(}
\is{predicative marking|(}
The default adjective attribution marking device in all West Saamic languages is anti\hyp{}construct state marking, just as in East Saamic.\il{East Saamic languages} Only the few members of a marginal subclass of adjectives are attributed by means of other devices. In general, West Saamic languages are similar to East Saamic in their high degree of irregularity in the morphological marking of attributive adjectives, although grammars of \ili{Northern Saami}, usually taking a rather normative-descriptive approach (e.g., \citealt{nickel1990,sammallahti1998b,svonni2009a}), stress the systemic character of attributive versus predicative marking with the suffix \textit{-(V)s} being the prototypical  formative for attributive morphology.

For another West Saamic language, Pite Saami, and using exclusively corpus data \citet[128–129]{wilbur2014a} argues that the formative \textit{-(V)s} is used much too irregularly to be considered a productive attributive suffix. Because of the considerable inconsistencies in morphological patterns between corresponding attributive and predicative adjectives, \citet[134]{wilbur2014a} generally prefers to analyze these two sets of adjectives simply as semantically and etymologically related, rather than morphologically derivable adjectives. However, even if a large part of these adjectives consists of suppletive pairs, the morpho-syntax of adjectives in Pite Saami shares one important characteristic with the other Saamic languages: whereas attributive adjectives never show morphological agreement, predicative adjectives agree (in \textsc{number}) with the subject noun phrase.

\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement|(}

For Northern Saami, the default attribution device is anti\hyp{}construct state marking, like in all Saamic languages. A few adjectives, however, regularly show agreement with the head noun in number and case. In Northern Saami, the adjective ‘good’ and sometimes also the adjective ‘bad’ follow this type.

\il{Indo-European languages|(}
\section{Indo-European}
%%%
Indo-European is among the world's language families with the greatest geographic distribution. Most of the European languages belong to this family. But Indo-European languages are spoken as far East as on the \isi{South Asia}n subcontinent. The family can be divided into nine branches \citep[218]{salminen2007}, all of which are represented in the present investigation.

The prototypical adjective attribution marking type in Indo-European is \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement}. This type is also reconstructed for the \ili{Proto\hyp{}Indo-European} language \citep{decsy1991,watkins1998}. Due to the development of certain secondary types of adjective attribution marking devices, however, divergence is relatively high inside the Indo-European family. Furthermore, in several branches of Indo-European, \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement} has been lost in favor of various other types of attribution marking (as will be shown in Part~IV Diachrony).

Among the languages of northern Eurasia, the Indo-European family exhibits the highest diversity with regard to the number of possible adjective attribution marking devices. The following types are attested in different Indo-European languages:
%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item juxtaposition\is{juxtaposition}
\item head\hyp{}driven agreement\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement}
\item construct-state marking

\is{attributive nominalization|(}
\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement|(}
\paragraph*{Attributive nominalization + head\hyp{}driven agreement in Albanian}
In both Albanian languages, adjectives normally follow the head noun and are marked with an article which links its host to the modified noun. Additionally, adjectives are equipped with agreement inflection suffixes co-referencing the \textsc{number}-, \textsc{gender}-, \textsc{case}- and \textsc{species}\is{species marking} values of the head noun. The language thus exhibits an attributive marking device which is a combination of a phonologically free article (historically an attributive nominalizer) and agreement suffixes.

%%%

\is{predicative marking|(}
Since adjectives in attributive and predicative position are both equipped with the circumfixed agreement marker the language seems to belong simply to the head\hyp{}driven agreement type. However, true predicative adjectives are not found in Albanian. Instead, attributive adjectives in \isi{headless noun phrase}s are used in predicative position. This is evidenced by case agreement of predicates.
%%%

\glt	‘I saw Agimi sorrowful’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

On the other hand, the similar agreement behavior of attributive and predicative adjectives seems to indicate the absence of specific attributive morpho-syntactic marking. However, the attributive article is polyfunctional and can also link other adnominal attributes in addition to adjectives to the modified noun. The analysis of adjective attribution marking in Albanian as belonging to the attributive nominalization type (in combination with head\hyp{}driven agreement) thus seems justified.

\paragraph*{Head\hyp{}driven agreement in Albanian}
Note, however, that the occurrence of the attributive article is restricted to a lexically defined subclass of adjectives in Albanian: only the so-called “article adjectives” are regularly marked with the article. Other adjectives are marked with head\hyp{}driven agreement affixes alone.

\il{Arvanitika|(}
\is{attributive nominalization|(}
\is{head\hyp{}driven agreement|(}
\paragraph*{Attributive nominalization + head\hyp{}driven agreement in Arvanitika}
Adjective attribution marking in Arvanitika is very similar to Standard \ili{Albanian}. One adjective class shows head\hyp{}driven agreement marking by means of suffixes. The second adjective class is cognate with the so-called “article adjectives” in Albanian and exhibits attributive nominalization. 
%%%
\begin{exe}

\begin{xlist}
\ex

				boy:\textsc{def.m} 	\textsc{m}-good:\textsc{m}\\
\glt	‘the good boy’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

Unlike in Standard Albanian,\il{Albanian} however, the preposed attributive nominalizer in Arvanitika is a phonologically bound formative. This is evidenced by its phonological behavior in adjective compounds, where the marker remains in its position bound to the adjective stem.
%%%
\begin{exe}
\ex {\rm Arvanitika \citep[304]{sasse1991}}
\label{alb noclitic}

%%%
\ex[*]{i-miso-ngrə́nə / tə-miso-ngrə́nə}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%%%

Example (\ref{alb noclitic}) shows that the compound degree word \textit{miso-} does not move between the adjective stem and the attributive nominalizer. Consequently, the nominalizer can be characterized as a \isi{clitic} (because it is phonologically bound but morpho-syntactically free) which always attaches on a fixed position, i.e., on the left of the adjective stem.\footnote{Note, however, that the agreement categories \textsc{case/number/gender} are merged into several differentiated morphemes in the suffixed part of the circumfix \citep[124–128]{sasse1991}.}

Stress patterns provide evidence for the analysis of Ossetic noun phrase structure as phonological compounds.

Note that stress, moving from the second to the first syllable marks definiteness\is{species marking!definite} in Ossetic \citep[12]{abaev1964}. There is, however, no evidence that the compounded adjectives are syntactically incorporated.

The Baltic languages form a small branch among Indo-European and are represented in the present survey only by the two languages Lithuanian\il{Lithuanian} and Latvian.\il{Latvian} Both belong to the eastern subbranch of Baltic.

Two types of adjective attribution marking occur in modern Baltic languages: head\hyp{}driven agreement and anti\hyp{}construct state agreement. In the descriptive literature on Baltic languages, however, these two noun phrase types are normally not ascribed to syntax, but are described as different agreement declension types determined by the definite or indefinite semantics of the noun phrase.

In \S\ref{anti-constr agr} of Part~II (Typology) I have already argued extensively in favor of a syntactic differentiation of these two agreement marking devices in Baltic (as well as in various Slavic)\il{Slavic languages} languages. Consequently and for the sake of completeness, examples of head\hyp{}driven agreement marking (the so-called indefinite declension) and anti\hyp{}construct state agreement marking (the so-called definite declension) in Latvian\il{Latvian} and Lithuanian\il{Lithuanian} will be repeated in the following paragraphs.

The modern Germanic languages belong to two branches: North\il{North Germanic languages} and West Germanic.\il{West Germanic languages} The third Germanic subbranch, East Germanic,\il{East Germanic languages} is extinct and is not considered here.

The constituent order of adjective and noun is relatively strictly head-final in all modern Germanic languages.\footnote{The exclusive adjective-initial constituent order in modern Germanic languages is clearly innovative. In documents of all \ili{Old Germanic languages}, the order of adjective and noun was still relatively free \citep[cf.][]{heinrichs1954}.} Most Germanic languages have also preserved the inherited agreement marking on attributive adjectives. But several secondary attributive marking devices have evolved at different stages in the history of Germanic.

The following noun phrase types occur inside the Germanic branch of Indo-European:
\begin{itemize}
%%%
\item{Anti\hyp{}construct state agreement}
\item{Anti\hyp{}construct state agreement + head\hyp{}driven agreement}
\item{Attributive article + \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement}}

The marker \textit{one} in English (originating from the homophonous numeral\is{adnominal modifier!numeral} \textit{one}) is a prototypical instance of an article: it constitutes a phonologically free grammatical word which is the target of agreement. 

Given that attributive adjectives cannot occur other than syntactically bound to a head noun, the regular noun phrase type in English is best analyzed as incorporation. Note that the article is not an attribution marking device in the proper sense. Even though the marker projects a noun phrase by syntactic nominalization, this noun phrase does not modify a higher noun. The nominalization strategy can only be used in noun phrases with an empty lexical head.

Swedish, \ili{Norwegian},\footnote{The two Norwegian standard languages Dano-Norwegian (Norwegian \textit{bokmål}) and New Norwegian (Norwegian \textit{nynorsk}) do not differ in their marking of adjective attribution and they will simply be referred to as Norwegian} and \ili{Faroese} exhibit two adjective attribution marking morphemes simultaneously: an inflectional suffix expressing the agreement features \textsc{gender}, \textsc{number} and \textsc{species}\is{species marking} (but the indefinite utrum gender form of the adjective is always unmarked) plus an article (which again is not found in the indefinite plural form).

\is{species marking!definite|(}
In the (North-)Germanic and typological linguistic tradition, the definite noun phrases with adjectives have most often been characterized as “double definite” (cf.~\citealt{kotcheva1996a}; \citealt{borjars1994}; \citealt{julien2003}; \citealt[354–355]{plank2003}). This makes sense from a historical perspective because the articles (Swedish \textit{den, det, de}) are cognate with the Old Germanic\il{Old Germanic languages} demonstratives which developed into definite markers (cf.~German\il{German} \textit{der, die, das} or English\il{English} \textit{the}). Synchronically, however, the articles in the North Germanic languages with so-called double definiteness (Swedish, both Norwegian\il{Norwegian} languages, Faroese)\il{Faroese} are not definiteness markers. Unlike in West Germanic,\il{West Germanic languages} definiteness is exclusively expressed by an inflectional suffix (Swedish \textit{-(e)n} \textsc{utr}, \textit{-(e)t} \textsc{n}, \textit{-n} \textsc{pl}.)
%"exclusively expressed"?\\if the NP is indef den/det is not used, so den/det has two functions: expressing def and marking attr

Unlike in West Germanic\il{West Germanic languages} languages, where the definite markers are noun phrase markers always attach at the left edge of the phrase, the presence or absence of the cognate articles \textit{den} \textsc{utr}, \textit{det} \textsc{n}, \textit{de(m)} \textsc{pl} in Swedish is determined by the availability of an adjective and not the referential status of the noun phrase.

\newpage 
Example (\ref{swedish np}) shows how the article can neither attach to a noun nor can an adjectival modifier in a definite noun phrase occur without being marked by the article.\footnote{The expression \textit{det hus} is grammatical only with the homophonous demonstrative \textit{det}, similarly (but restricted to certain regiolects) \textit{det hus-et}. Even the expressions \textit{höga hus-et} is possible for some expression similar to English \textit{White house}. Note also that possessive pronouns\is{adnominal modifier!pronoun} replace the article: \textit{min hög-a hus} [\textsc{poss:1sg} high-\textsc{def.n} house(\textsc{n}] 'my high house’.} Since the definite value of the feature \textsc{species} is always marked by the respective definite inflectional noun suffixes %in \isi{headless noun phrase}s, the definite inflection is absent 
 and since the article only attaches to adjectives, the latter cannot be analyzed as anything but a morpho-syntactic device, i.e., as an adjective attribution marker.

In definite noun phrases, Swedish thus exhibits a circumfixed adjective attribution marking device combined by head\hyp{}driven agreement inflection plus the article. It is plausible that the article developed from an attributive nominalizer. Its use with adjectives in \isi{headless noun phrase}s, as in \REF{art0} resembles attributive nominalization. There is, however, no evidence that the adjective marked by the article is part of a complex constituent (i.e., a \isi{headless noun phrase}) modifying a noun. According to the definition of \isi{attributive nominalization} presented in \S\ref{attr nmlz} of Part~II (Typology), the article in Swedish is thus not a syntactic nominalizer. Its function is the licensing of the attributive state of the adjective along with marking of head\hyp{}driven agreement. Since head\hyp{}driven agreement is additionally marked by inflectional suffixes, the Swedish noun phrase exhibits circum-positioned (i.e., phonologically free and phonologically bound) agreement marking.

Note that the circum-positioned agreement marker only occurs with attributive adjectives. Predicative adjectives, on the other hand, exhibit “pure” gender and number agreement (\ref{swed pred}).

The unmarked and prototypical noun phrase type in Romance is \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement} with the adjective following the noun. Besides the basic head-initial constituent order, most Romance languages exhibit a small subgroup of very common adjectives, such as ‘good–bad, young–old, small–large’, which normally precede the head noun (\citealt[146–147]{posner1996}, cf.~also \citealt[340]{silvestri1998}). However, most other adjectives can also precede the noun in the modern Romance languages. This reversed constituent order is regularly determined by semantics-pragmatics in Romanian and is used to give these adjectives a certain emphasis or contrastive focus, as in the following examples from Romanian (\ref{romanian wo}) and Italian (\ref{italian wo}).

Note that the definite\is{species marking!definite} marker in Romanian is not connected with attribution marking on adjectives. Even though the marker can occur on the attributive adjective which precedes the noun in contrastive use (\ref{romanian wo}), definiteness is a purely morpho-semantic feature in Romanian and is not assigned by syntax (see also Chapter~\ref{syntax-morphology-interface} of Part~I Preliminaries).

The common distinction between an “emphatic” adjective preceding a noun and a “descriptive” adjective following a noun goes probably back to the earliest stages of Romance, although it is first attested in Classical Latin\il{Latin!Classical} \citep[146]{posner1996}.

\label{slavic synchr}
Slavic (aka Slavonic)\il{Slavonic|see{Slavic languages}} forms a branch inside the Indo-European family. All Slavic languages are spoken in \isi{Europe}, except Russian, which is also spoken in \isi{North Asia}.

The prototypical type of adjective attribution marking is \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement}. The prototypical agreement features characteristic of Slavic languages are \textsc{number}, \textsc{gender} and \textsc{case}. In the closely related South Slavic languages \ili{Bulgarian} and \ili{Macedonian} however, case inflection of nouns and adjectives has been lost.

Beside \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement}, anti\hyp{}construct state agreement arose in Slavic languages as a secondary type of adjective attribution marking. The opposition between head\hyp{}driven and anti\hyp{}construct state agreement can be traced back to all Old Slavic\il{Old Slavic languages} languages and already existed in the oldest Slavic manuscripts, the best documented of which are from \ili{Old Bulgarian} (aka Old Church Slavonic).\il{Old Church Slavonic|see{Old Bulgarian}} To a certain extent, this state of development is still reflected in South Slavic.\il{South Slavic languages} In most other modern Slavic languages, however the opposition between the two types was lost by abolishing one or the other type.

Basically, the modern Slavic languages belong to three types and exhibit the following three attribution marking devices:
%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item exclusively \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement}
\item exclusively anti\hyp{}construct state agreement
\item simultaneously \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement} and anti\hyp{}construct state agreement
\item attributive nominalization.\is{attributive nominalization}

Constituent order in Slavic can be described as basically adjective-noun, although there is much variation across the single languages. The reversed order of constituents is often possible but in some languages it is restricted to “emphasized” constructions or poetic language.

The examples with “short form” adjectives in definite contexts and “long form” adjectives in indefinite contexts provides the best evidence against the analyses of the two different adjective agreement suffixes as markers of the category \textsc{species} of the head noun. 

\largerpage[2]
Rather than as a definite marker, the long-form adjective agreement suffixes in Serbian are best analyzed as anti\hyp{}construct state agreement markers used in special contrastive focus constructions.\footnote{Note even that school grammars of Serbian sometimes explain the rules for the use of the two adjective declensions with the help of the the questions “what sort?” (requires the “short form”) and “which one?” (requires the “long form”) \citep[327]{browne1993}.}

Note, however, that the use of morphologically differentiated adjectives for \isi{head\hyp{}driven agreement} versus anti\hyp{}construct state agreement in Slovenian is very restricted and is found more or less only with masculine adjectives in nominative singular \citep[410–411]{priestly1993}.

Anti\hyp{}construct agreement marking are thus analyzed as attribution marking device with the additional content of contrastive focus rather than as a detached definite marker.

The attributive article \textit{ta} in Slovenian is homophonous with the demonstrative determiner (from which it originates historically), but \REF{slovenian def} with the double use of \textit{ta} on stacked adjectives and after the determiner clearly shows that these markers serve two different functions: whereas \textit{ta} \textsc{dem} is a determiner marking the noun phrase for special local deictic species \textit{ta} \textsc{attr} is an attributive marker (i.e., a true article) attaching to the adnominal adjective. Attribution of the adjective in contrastive focus in \REF{slovenian art} is marked by means of attributive nominalization (in combination with head\hyp{}driven agreement).

According to \citet{marusic-etal2007,marusic-etal2007b}, the article \textit{ta} gives the adjective a classifying reading and the construction \textit{ta}+A:\textsc{attr} can be compared to a “reduced relative clause”,\is{adnominal modifier!relative clause} hence a syntactic complement to the noun.

Note that the features \textsc{species},\is{species marking} \textsc{number}, and \textsc{case} in \REF{basque juxtap} are not assigned to the adjective through agreement. The corresponding portmanteau suffixes marking the values of these morphological features always attach to right edge of the phrase in Basque. Consequently, they always attach to the attributive adjective if one is present \citep[171]{hualde-etal2003}
