The following chapter contains an overall survey of adjective attribution marking devices which occur in the languages of northern Eurasia. For each genealogical unit, both the prototypical and the known minor noun phrase type(s) will be characterized and illustrated with examples. A complete list of adjective attribution marking devices in over 200 single languages considered for the present survey is found in Table \ref{sample} starting on page \pageref{sample} in the appendix. The geographic spread of the different noun phrase types is shown on several Maps starting on page \pageref{WorldMap} in the appendix.

\section{Eskimo-Aleut}
\subsection{Eskimo}
\subsubsection{Yupic}
Whereas most languages of the Eskimo-Aleut family are spoken on islands in the Bering Strait or on the North American continent, a few varieties of the Yupik subbranch of Eskimo can be localized to north-easternmost Siberia. But only one of these languages, Central Siberian Yupic, is still spoken \cite[224]{salminen2007}.

In Central Siberian Yupic, only one adjective attribution marking device is attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Incorporation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Adjective incorporation in Central Siberian Yupic}
Property words (“adjectives”) in Central Siberian Yupic are phonologically bound nominal roots. Adjectival modification is thus expressed by means of polysynthetic morphology and can be characterized as adjective incorporation according to the ontology presented in Part \ref{part typ}.
\begin{exe}

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Chukotkan}
The Chukotkan language family (aka Chukchi-Koryak) consists of two bran\-ches. The first branch, Chukchi, is represented by only one language, Chukchi, which has the same name as the branch itself. The second branch, Koryak, is represented by the two languages Alutor and Koryak. A third branch, Kerek, is probably extinct \cite[253]{salminen2007} and consequently not considered here.\\

\noindent Constituent order inside the noun phrase of Chukotkan languages is strictly head-final. Adjective attribution marking is also similar in all Chukotkan languages. Two types are attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Incorporation
\item Head-driven agreement.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chukchi}
\paragraph{Adjective incorporation in Chukchi}
The use of the bound adjective morpheme in the polysynthetic structure (similar to Yupic) is illustrated in the following examples.\footnote{The vowel -ə- in these and the following examples is epenthetic.}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Chukchi} \citep{skorik1960}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{elg-}ə-qoranə\\
	white-ə-deer:\textsc{abs.sg}\\
\glt	‘white reindeer’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{elg-}ə-qorat\\
	white-ə-deer:\textsc{abs.pl}\\
\glt	‘white reindeer (pl)’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Koryak}
\paragraph{Adjective incorporation in Alutor}
Similar to Chukchi, adjective incorporation is the default adjective attribution marking device in Alutor.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Alutor} \citep{nagayama2003}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{meŋ-}ə-rara-ŋa\\
	big-ə-house-\textsc{abs.sg}\\
\glt	‘large house’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{meŋ-}ə-rara-wwi\\
	big-ə-house-\textsc{abs.pl}\\
\glt	‘large houses’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Chukchi and Alutor}
Whereas adjective incorporation is the default and unmarked type of adjective attribution marking in Alutor and Chukchi, several descriptions of the Chukotkan languages mention that adjectives can also occur in an unbound form (for Alutor \citealt{nagayama2003}; for Chukchi \citealt[103–104, 421–429]{skorik1960}, \citealt[251]{comrie1981}). As unbound morphemes adjectives take the stative marker \textit{n-} as well as agreement markers for person, number and case.
\begin{exe}
\ex \label{chukchi alutor free adj}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textsc{Chukchi} \citep{skorik1960}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{n-ilg-ə-qin-Ø} qoranə\\
	\textsc{stat}-white-ə-\textsc{3sg} deer:\textsc{abs.sg}\\
\glt	‘white reindeer’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{n-ilg-ə-qine-t} qorat\\
	\textsc{stat}-white-ə-3-\textsc{pl} deer:\textsc{abs.pl}\\
\glt	‘white reindeer (pl)’
\end{xlist}
\ex \textsc{Alutor} \citep{nagayama2003}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{n-ə-meŋ-ə-qin} rara-ŋa\\
	\textsc{stat}-ə-big-ə-\textsc{abs:3sg} house-\textsc{abs.sg}\\
\glt	‘large house’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{n-ə-meŋ-ə-laŋ} rara-wwi\\
	\textsc{stat}-ə-big-ə-\textsc{abs:3pl} house-\textsc{abs.pl}\\
\glt	‘large houses’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The number/person/case-agreement suffixes of adjectives and the suffixes mar\-king possessive inflection of nouns belong to one and the same para\-digm. Consequently, one could also interpret the Alutor and Chukchi data as another instance of modifier-headed possessor agreement (as in Oroch described in Section \ref{ModheadAgr}). If so, the examples in (\ref{chukchi alutor free adj}) should be translated literally as ‘reindeer's whiteness’, ‘house's bigness’. An analysis against syntactic head shift between noun and adjective, however, is preferred here for two reasons: The first reason is the constituent order inside the noun phrase. The assumed head shift to a modifier-headed possessor agreement construction would violate the otherwise strictly head-final constituent order rule in Alutor and Chukchi. 

The other reason for arguing against syntactic head shift between noun and adjective is that in order to use non-incorporating constructions as in the examples in (\ref{chukchi alutor free adj}) the adjective is first transformed into a stative verb by means of a verbalizing prefix (\textit{-n}, glossed as \textsc{stat} in example \ref{chukchi alutor free adj}).

The verbalizer together with the agreement affix is sometimes glossed as an adjectivizing circumfix (\textsc{adjz>-\dots-<adjz:agr}), for instance in Nagayama's (\citeyear{nagayama2003}) grammatical description of Alutor. The given noun phrase type should then perhaps be analyzed as attributive state marking (as in Russian, see Sections \ref{anti-constr agr} and \ref{russian synchr}). Unlike in Russian, however, the same agreement marking as in attributive constructions shows up on predicates as well.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Alutor} \citep{nagayama2003}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	{\bf n-ə-tur-}iɣəm\\
	\textbf{\textsc{stat}-ə-young-}\textsc{1sg}\\
\glt	‘I'm young’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Consequently, an analysis of adjective attribution marking in Alutor and Chuk\-chi as belonging to the state marking type is rejected.

The semantic difference between the two constructions, with adjective incorporation on the one hand hand and head-driven agreement marking on the other hand, is not clear. Whereas adjective incorporation is often described as the main or even only possible type (for Chukchi cf.~\citealt[37, 101]{kampfe-etal1995}), \citet[288]{kibrik-etal2000} states that this type indicates the corresponding quality or property as referring to background information in Alutor.

The following example from Chukchi on the other hand, indicates that the non-incorporated adjective is used in an emphasized construction. Sentence (\ref{chukchi free adj}) was elicited in order to find examples of multiple modifiers in one noun phrase, which seems to be avoided by speakers of Chukchi \cite[330]{rijkhoff2002}. In sentence (\ref{chukchi inc adj}) with the incorporated adjective, the speaker simply left out the demonstrative when translating into Chukchi.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Chukchi} \cite[330]{rijkhoff2002}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{chukchi free adj}
\gll	əngena-t ngəroq \textbf{n-ilg-ə-qine-t} qora-t\\
	this-\textsc{pl} three \textsc{stat}-white-ə-3-\textsc{pl} deer-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘these three white reindeer’
\ex \label{chukchi inc adj}
\gll	ətlon ga-twetcha-twa-len ga-ngəron-\textbf{elg-}ə-qaa-ma\\
	\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pfct}-stand\_up-be-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{com}-white-ə-deer-\textsc{com}\\
\glt	‘He stood next to (these) three white reindeer.’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\citet[716]{bogoras1922} states that the circum-positioned marker of the unbound adjective “sometimes corresponds to the definite article or designates an object as referred to before.” The unbound adjective, on the other hand, can only occur in absolute case which is inherently connected to semantic definiteness \citep[cf.][207, elsewhere]{dunn1999}.


\section{Kamchatkan}
The only surviving member of the Kamchatkan language family is Itelmen (aka Western Kamchadal) \citep[224]{salminen2007}.

The only attested type of adjective attribution marking in Itelmen is:\footnote{According to Volodin (\citeyear{volodin1997}) a few adjectives (among them Russian loan adjectives) occur in juxtaposition.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anti-construct state agreement.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking in Itelmen} \label{itelmen synchr}
Constituent order inside the noun phrase of Itelmen is head-final. Adjectives form a class syntactically clearly distinguished from nouns: unlike the latter, adjectives are never represented by their root morphemes alone. Unlike verbs, which take TAM markers, adjectives take adjectival morphology and are licensed either by an attributive or predicative (adverbal) suffix (\citealt{volodin1997}, \citealt[54]{georg-etal1999}).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Itelmen} \citep{volodin1997} \label{itelmen ex}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Attributive state of adjectives
\gll	thun\textbf{-lah}\\
	dark-\textsc{attr}\\
\glt	‘dark’
\ex Predicative state of adjectives
\gll	thun\textbf{-k}\\
	dark-\textsc{pred}\\
\glt	‘(is) dark’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Since attributive adjectives also agree in case (though restricted to instrumental case), the noun phrase type can be characterized as anti-construct state agreement, structurally similar to the type found in Russian. Consider the following example.\footnote{Note that the shape of the state marking suffix \textit{-lan'ļ} ($\leftarrow$ \textit{-lah-ļ}) is the result of a regular morpho-phonological process \citep{georg-etal1999}.}

\begin{exe}
\ex Anti-construct state agreement in \textsc{Itelmen} \cite{georg-etal1999}
\gll	Kəmma çasit t'-nu-qz-al-kiçen \textbf{teŋ-lan'ļ} \textbf{thalthe-ļ}, min kn-anke t-zapasa-qzo-çen.\\
	\textsc{1sg} now \textsc{1sg}>-eat-\textsc{ipfv-fut-<1sg} good-\textsc{attr:ins} meat-\textsc{ins} \textsc{rel} \textsc{1sg-dat} \textsc{1sg}-keep-\textsc{ipfv-3sg-prtc}\\
\glt	‘Now I will eat the good meat which I kept for you.’
\end{exe}

\section{Nivkh}
Nivkh (aka Gilyak) is an isolated language spoken in the far east on the Eurasian continent on Sakhalin Island (Russia) \citep[222–223]{salminen2007}.

The only type of adjective attribution marking attested in Nivkh is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Head-driven agreement.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Nivkh}
\noindent Property words in Nivkh are verbal roots. As modifiers in noun phrases these adjectival verbs occur to the left of the head noun in a construction which is sometimes described as a polysynthetic structure (cf.~\citealt[16]{gruzdeva1998}; \citealt[80]{jakobson1971}, quoted by \citealt[138]{rijkhoff2002}). The reason for analyzing adjectives in Nivkh as being incorporated into the modified noun is the phonological boundedness of the constituents evidenced by regular alternations in the initial segments of the noun stem \cite[16]{gruzdeva1998}.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Nivkh} \citep[16]{gruzdeva1998}
\begin{xlist}
\ex tu ‘lake’
\ex 
\gll	pily-du\\
	be\_big-lake\\
\glt	‘large lake’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
In her sketch grammar of Nivkh, however, \cite{gruzdeva1998} glosses adjectival words consequently as morphologically unbound words.\footnote{For instance \textit{čuz pitɣy-Ø} [new book-\textsc{nom}] (19), \textit{kyla n'iɣvn̦} [high man] (33), \textit{pila eri} [big river] (38).}

Interestingly, the phonological stem alternation rules also apply to the plural inflection of nouns and their adjectival attributes by means of reduplication. Thus, in (\ref{nivkh redup}), the reduplicated stem of the participle \textit{m'osk̦} ‘destroyed’ is realized as \textit{-zosk̦} and the reduplicated stem of the noun \textit{mu} ‘boat’ is realized as \textit{-ɣu}.\footnote{Note that initial nasals, as in the noun stem \textit{mu} bound to the adjective in (\ref{nivkh unaltered}) do not alternate.}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Nivkh} (Gruzdeva pc) \label{nivkh redup}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	tuin \textbf{t'osq-mu} hum-d'\\
	here break.\textsc{ptcp}-boat be-\textsc{ind}\\
\glt	‘there is a destroyed boat here’ 
\ex	\label{nivkh unaltered}
\gll	tuin \textbf{t'osq\textasciitilde zosk̦-mu\textasciitilde ɣu} hum-d'[-ɣu]\\
	here break.\textsc{ptcp}-\textsc{pl}-boat-\textsc{pl} be-\textsc{ind}[-\textsc{pl}]\\
\glt	‘there are destroyed boats here’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the number agreement of the attributive forms of adjectives by means of reduplication seems to be archaic. According to Gruzdeva (pc), attributive adjectives practically never reduplicate any more. Examples of reduplicating adjectives are, however, included in the grammar of Panfilov (\citeyear{panfilov1965}).

\section{Ainu}
Ainu is an isolate spoken on Hokkaido Island in northern Japan.

The only type of adjective attribution marking attested in Ainu is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Ainu}
\label{ainu synchr}
Ainu does not exhibit morphological differences between adjectives and verbs \citep[27]{refsing1986}. Words expressing states (\ref{ainu state}) or properties (\ref{aini qual}) in Ainu are best described as stative verbs. They form a subclass of intransitive verbs and are only semantically distinguished from verbs denoting an action \cite[141–142]{refsing1986}. As modifiers of a noun these property words are juxtaposed to the left.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Ainu (Shizunai dialect)} \cite[142]{refsing1986}%CHECK PAGES
\begin{xlist}
\ex “State adjective” \label{ainu state}
\gll	\textbf{mokor} cep\\
	sleep fish\\
\glt	‘a sleeping fish’
\ex “Quality adjective” \label{aini qual}
\gll	\textbf{pirka} cep\\
	be\_good fish\\
\glt	‘a fine fish’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Japanese}
The noun phrase structure in Japanese, an isolated language, is strictly head-final. Two types of adjective attribution marking devices are attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Anti-construct state marking.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Japanese}
Two distinct lexical classes of words describe the state that an entity is in. Verbal adjectives belong to the first class. These adjectives are distinguished from stative verbs by the adjectivizer suffix \textit{-i}. Used as predicates, the adjectivized verbs marked with \textit{-i} follow the noun but do not require any copula. Attributive adjectives, on the other hand, are juxtaposed to the left of the modified noun. 

\begin{exe}
\ex Verbal adjectives in \textsc{Japanese} \citep[170]{backhouse1984}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Adjective predication 
\gll	kona rombun-wa \textbf{naga-i}\\
	this article-\textsc{top} long-\textsc{adjz}\\%check gloss ?PRES
\glt	‘This article is long.’
\ex Adjective attribution
\gll	\textbf{naga-i} rombun\\
	long-\textsc{adjz} article\\
\glt	‘long article’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Since the adjectivizer suffix \textit{-i} simply derives adjectives from stative verbs and marks both predicates and attributes it is not considered an attribution marking device. Hence, the class of verbal adjectives in Japanese is merely attributed by juxtaposition. Word order is crucial for differentiating attributive from predicative adjectives. 

\paragraph{Anti-construct state marking in Japanese}
Unlike “verbal adjectives”, which were described in the previous section, the few members of the second adjectival sub-class, i.e.~“nominal adjectives” require a special attributive form marked by the invariable attributive suffix \textit{-na}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Japanese} \citep[72-81]{pustet1989}%REF stimmt nicht
\begin{xlist}
\ex Attribution: verbal adjective
\gll	\textbf{waka-i} hito\\
	young-\textsc{adjz} person\\
\glt	‘a young person’
\ex Attribution: nominal adjective
\gll	\textbf{kiree-na} hito\\
	beautiful-\textsc{attr} person\\
\glt	‘a beautiful person’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the word class boundary between nominal adjectives and nouns in Japanese is not always clear because some words take either the noun attribution marker \textit{-no} (\ref{japan na}) or the adjective attribution marker \textit{-na} (\ref{japan no}) when modifying a noun. The arbitrary behavior of attribution marking of nouns and nominal adjectives in Japanese indicates the continuous nature of these two word classes in this language \citep[79-80]{pustet1989}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Japanese} \citep[72-81]{pustet1989}%REF stimmt nicht
\begin{xlist}
\ex Noun attribution \label{japan na}

\gll	\textbf{wazuka-no} okane\\
	little-\textsc{attr} money\\
\glt	‘little money’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Korean}
Korean is an isolated language spoken on the Korean peninsula in northeastern Asia. The only type of adjective attribution marking attested in Korean is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Anti-construct state marking.
\end{itemize}
Note, however, that Korean does not have a distinct class of adjectives but adjectival notions are expressed by verbs.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state marking in Korean}
The constituent order in the noun phrase of Korean is strictly head-final. Modifying “property words” are verbs equipped with a special attributive suffix \textit{-(u)n} \citep{martin-etal1969}.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Korean} \citep[61]{chang1996}

\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Sinotibetan}\label{sinotibetan synchr}
\subsection{Sinitic}
\subsubsection{Chinese}
The Sinotibetan language family is represented in northern Eurasia only by one language, Dungan (aka Dunganese), which is a Gansu variety of Northern Chinese spoken in the Kyrgyz Republic in Central Asia (cf.~\citealt[85]{yuo2003}, \citealt{kalimov1968}).\\

\noindent Two types of adjective attribution marking are attested in Dungan:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Attributive nominalization.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Dungan}
Adjective attribution marking in the unmarked noun phrase in Dungan is characterized by juxtaposition. Hereby, the adjective either precedes or follows the noun.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Dungan} \cite[480]{kalimov1968} \label{dungan juxtap}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 	
\gll	\textbf{da} fonzy\\
	big house\\
\ex
\gll	fonzy \textbf{da}\\
	house big\\
\glt	‘large house’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Dungan}
A second noun phrase type with the adjectival modifier marked by a suffix \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} occurs in Dungan as well. Whereas juxtaposition constitutes the general and unmarked type of adjective attribution marking, the nominalization device seems to be much more restricted and occurs for example in connection with a comparative (\ref{dungan compattr}) or negated attribute (\ref{dungan negattr}).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Dungan}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Negated attribute \cite[80]{zevachina2001} \label{dungan negattr}
\gll	gubuə\textsuperscript{3} bu\textsuperscript{1} \textbf{da\textsuperscript{3}-di\textsuperscript{1}} gun\textsuperscript{1}fu\textsuperscript{1}\\
	went \textsc{neg} big-\textsc{attr} time\\
\glt	‘Not much (lit. ‘not big’) time passed.’
\ex Comparative attribute \cite[480]{kalimov1968} \label{dungan compattr}
\gll	\textbf{da-ščer-di} fonzy\\
	bigger-\textsc{compar}-\textsc{attr} house\\
\glt	‘a somewhat larger (i.e.~different) house’\footnote{Note that the quoted transcriptions of the two authors differ from each other.}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}	
The marker \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} is clearly cognate with the functionally similar nominalizer \textit{-de} in Mandarin Chinese (cf.~Example \ref{multi mand} in Section \ref{polyfunctionality}). In Dungan, however, \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} is sometimes also described as a marker of predicative adjectives, as in (\ref{dungan emphpred}).
\begin{exe}
\ex	Attributive nominalization in \textsc{Dungan} \cite[82]{zevachina2001}
\label{dungan emphpred}
\gll	ž̨y\textsuperscript{3}gə\textsuperscript{1} mə\textsuperscript{1}mə\textsuperscript{2} \textbf{gan\textsuperscript{1}-di\textsuperscript{1}}\\
	this bread stale-\textsc{attr}\\
\glt	‘This bread is STALE (i.e.~different).’
\end{exe}
\citet[82]{zevachina2001} labels the function of the marker as an “emphasizing-predicative”. But looking at her other examples it becomes obvious that \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} does not mark predicative adjectives but rather nominalized attributive adjectives.
\begin{exe}
\ex Attributive nominalization in \textsc{Dungan} \cite[82]{zevachina2001}
\gll	ž̨y\textsuperscript{3}gə\textsuperscript{1} fu\textsuperscript{1} bu\textsuperscript{1}cy\textsuperscript{1} \textbf{xun\textsuperscript{1}-di\textsuperscript{1}}, \textbf{zy\textsuperscript{2}-di\textsuperscript{1}}\\
	this book \textsc{neg} red-\textsc{attr} bordeaux-\textsc{attr}\\
\glt	‘This book is not RED, but BORDEAUX.’\\
	(lit. ‘This book is not a red one, but a bordeaux one.’)
\end{exe}
The nominalizing function of the suffix is also described by \cite{kalimov1968}.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex Attributive nominalization \textsc{Dungan} \cite[484]{kalimov1968} \label{dungan nmlz}
\gll	\textbf{ščin-di} gǔjdixyn\\
	new-\textsc{attr} expensive\\
\glt	‘The new (one) is expensive.’
\end{exe}
Attributive marking with the suffix \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}} in Dungan needs to be investigated in more detail, especially in connection to word order. The head-initial structure seems to be used in order to emphasize the property denoted by the adjective.

However, according to the descriptions of Dungan taken into account here (i.e.~\citealt{kalimov1968} and \citealt{zevachina2001}), the language exhibits two adjective attribution marking devices: juxtaposition and attributive nominalization by means of the article \textit{-di\textsuperscript{1}}. While juxtaposition (with the order adjective-noun) seems to be the unmarked type, attributive nominalization is restricted to certain pragmatically marked constructions.

\section{Mongolic}
%Mongolic-nördliches China: Dagurisch, Mongorisch, Bao'an, Donxiang, Oirat
The Mongolic language family consists of five branches (cf.~\citealt[222]{salminen2007}): The core branch, Mongolian, includes the languages Kalmyk, Khalkha, Khamnigan Mongol, and Oyrat (aka Oirat). Kalmyk is spoken in easternmost Europe (in the Republic of Kalmykia of the Russian Federation). The other Mongolian languages are all spoken in Central Asia, along with Dagur which belongs to a satellite branch of the Mongolic family. Languages of the remaining 3 satellite branches of Mongolic are not considered here since they are all spoken outside the northern Eurasian area.\\
				
\noindent With regard to their principal noun phrase structure, all Mongolic languages of northern Eurasia exhibit the inherited proto-Mongolian features, including strictly head-final word order and juxtaposition of attributive adjectives (“adjecti\-val nouns”) as the only attribution marking device.

Note, however, that adjectives in Mongolic languages do not differ formally from regular nouns but are distinguishable from the latter only by their syntactic behavior and specific derivational patterns (cf.~\citealt[10]{janhunen2003b} for proto-Mongolic and \citealt[161]{svantesson2003} for Khalkha).\footnote{In the two Mongolic languages Moghol (spoken in Afghanistan) and Mangghuer (spoken in China) there is a distinct class of adjectives (cf.~\citealt[252]{weiers2003} for Moghol and \citealt[311]{slater2003} for Mangghuer). However, these languages are not considered since they are spoken outside the northern Eurasian area.}\\

\noindent The only type of adjective attribution marking attested in Mongolic languages of northern Eurasia is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mongolian}
\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Khalkha}
The only attested adjective attribution marking device in the languages of the Monguor branch of Mongolic is \textbf{juxtaposition}, similar to the following example.

\subsection{Monguor}
The only attested adjective attribution marking device in the languages of the Monguor branch of Mongolic is \textbf{juxtaposition} \citep{slater2003}, similar to example (\ref{khalkha juxt}) from Khalkha Mongolian.

\subsection{Moghol}
The only attested adjective attribution marking device in the languages of the Moghol branch of Mongolic is \textbf{juxtaposition} \citep{weiers2003}, similar to example (\ref{khalkha juxt}) from Khalkha Mongolian.

\subsection{Dagur}
The only attested adjective attribution marking device in the languages of the Dagur branch of Mongolic is \textbf{juxtaposition} \citep{tsumagari2003}, similar to example (\ref{khalkha juxt}) from Khalkha Mongolian.

\section{Tungusic} \label{tungusic synchr}
The Tungusic language family (aka Manchu-Tungus) comprises several languages belonging to the three branches North-Tungusic, Amur Tungusic and Manchu, all spoken in southern Siberia (Russia), northern Mongolia and northern China.\\

\noindent The constituent order inside the noun phrase in all Tungusic languages is relatively strictly head-final. In several Tungusic languages, attributive adjectives (“adjectival nouns”) are simply juxtaposed with the modified noun. This type is also mentioned as being prototypical of adjective attribution marking devices in Tungusic languages (e.g.~\citealt{sunik1968a}; \citealt[133]{kormusin2005}). However, several other types occur as well. The following adjective attribution marking devices are attested in Tungusic:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Head-driven agreement
\item Attributive nominalization
\item Modifier-headed possessor agreement.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{North-Tungusic}
Languages belonging to the northern branch of Tungusic are Even (aka Lamut), Evenki (aka Oroqen in China), Negidal and Solon (aka Ewenke in China).\\

\noindent The major North-Tungusic languages, Even and Evenki, deviate from the Tungusic prototype and exhibit head-driven agreement as their general type (\citealt[11]{malchukov1995}; \citealt[18]{bulatova-etal1999}). Attributive nominalization and modifier-headed possessor agreement occur in these two languages as well, even though these devices are restricted to specially marked noun phrase types.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Even}
According to \citet[20]{malchukov1995}, the occurrence of head-driven agreement of adjectives in Even is determined by discourse-pragmatic factors: Attributes in the rhematic (focus) position always agree with their heads, whereas agreement is optional in non-focus positions \cite[31–32]{malchukov1995}.\footnote{According to \cite[31]{malchukov1995}, regular head-driven agreement occurs as the default type of adjective attribution marking only in literary Even and hence in prescriptive grammars. This does not reflect, however, the actual language use.}
\begin{exe}
\ex “Attribute raising agreement” in \textsc{Even}
\cite[30–31]{malchukov1995} \label{even raising}

\glt	‘I have brought back only strong men.’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\citet[30–31]{malchukov1995} describes the attributive agreement patterns in Even in a hierarchical way: The adjective modifier can agree in all morphological features of the head-noun (\ref{even agr}) or just in number (\ref{even numagr}). Juxtaposition is also possible but restricted to adjectives in non-focus position (\ref{even juxt}).

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Even (I)}
The “attribute raising agreement” illustrated in the previous section in (\ref{even raising}) can be extended with a fourth step, specifically with adjective attributes marked by the restrictive marker \textit{=takan/\-=teken} (here glossed as a nominalizer).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Even} \cite[32]{malchukov1995}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{Eŋi-l-bu=tken} beji-l-bu emu-re-m.\\
	strong-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{acc}=\textsc{nmlz} man-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{acc} bring-\textsc{nonfut}-\textsc{1sg}\\
\ex	
\gll	* \textbf{Eŋi=tken} beji-l-bu emu-re-m.\\
	{} strong=\textsc{nmlz} man-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{acc} bring-\textsc{nonfut}-\textsc{1sg}\\
\glt	‘I have brought back only strong men.’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Attributes marked as “restrictive” obligatorily agree with the head noun \cite[32]{malchukov1995}. Noun phrases marked by means of \textit{=takan / =teken} thus resemble the attributive nominalization type, i.e.~the attribute is marked as a syntactically complex constituent (i.e.~as an embedded complement to the head noun) by means of nominalization.

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Even (II)}
A second attributive nominalization strategy by means of the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular (in “determinative” function; here glossed as a nominalizer) is attested in an investigation of the non-possessive use of the possessive marker in different Turkic and Tungusic languages \citep{benzing1993b}.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Even} \cite[17–18 Footnote 58]{benzing1993b}
\gll	hagdiŋata\textbf{-n} orolcemŋā\\
	oldest-\textsc{nmlz} reindeer\_herder\\
\glt	‘the OLDEST reindeer herder’%\footnote{The source does not provide glosses for this example.}
\end{exe}
According to \citet[17–18 Footnote 58]{benzing1993b}, the “determinative” suffix {\it -n} ($\Leftarrow$ \textsc{poss:3sg}) can be used as a marker of contrastive focus in Even.

\paragraph{Modifier-headed possessor agreement in Evenki} Evenki follows the general Tungusic rule of head-final constituent ordering inside the noun phrase. In constructions emphasizing the property denoted by the attributive adjectives, however, the unmarked adjective-noun order can be reversed. In these constructions, the adjective is obligatorily equipped with the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person (singular or plural).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Evenki} \citep[18]{bulatova-etal1999} 
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{aja} bəjə\\
	good man\\
\glt	‘good man’
\ex	\label{evenki poss}
\gll	bi: bəjə \textbf{aja-βa:-n} sa:-m\\
	\textsc{1sg} man good-\textsc{acc}-\textsc{poss:3sg} know-\textsc{1sg}\\
\glt	‘I know the GOOD man’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
According to \citet[18]{bulatova-etal1999}, the phrase final adjective ‘good’ marked with the possessive suffix is used as a true possessive noun in example (\ref{evenki poss}) and they translate the example like this: ‘I know the man's goodness’. This construction, however, is similar to the modifier-headed possessor agreement described for Oroch (cf.~example \ref{oroch modhead}) and Udege (\citealt[485, elsewhere]{nikolaeva-etal2001}).\footnote{Similar modifier-headed constructions are found in Even where modifier-headed possessor agreement is in fact attested, cf.~\textit{Asatkan \textbf{nood-do-n} haaram.} [girl beautiful-\textsc{acc}-\textsc{poss:3sg} I\_know] \citep[11]{malchukov1995}. But unlike similar modifier-headed participles (in possessor agreement constructions) in Even \citep[31]{malchukov1995} and similar modifier-headed adjectives in Oroch (\citealt{malchukov2000}, cf.~even example \ref{oroch modhead}) Malchukov translates this example as a true possessive construction with a nominal attribute: ‘I know the girl's beauty’ (but not: ‘I know the beautiful girl’).}

\subsection{Amur Tungusic}
The Amur (aka Southern) branch of Tungusic consists of five languages. According to \citet[223]{salminen2007}, however, it is better to assume two separate subbranches: one of them comprising Udege and Oroch and the other comprising Nanay (aka Hejen in China), Ulcha and Orok (aka Uilta).

\subsubsection{Oroch-Udege}
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Udege}
Head-driven agreement in Udege is restricted to the feature \textsc{number}. Morphologically plural head nouns trigger plural marking on the attributive adjective obligatorily.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Udege} \citep[468]{nikolaeva-etal2001}
\gll	uligdig'a\textbf{-ŋku} moxo-ziga bi-si-ti\\
	beautiful\textsc{-pl} cup\textsc{-pl} be\textsc{-pst-3pl}\\
\glt	‘There were beautiful cups.’
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Modifier-headed possessor agreement in Oroch}
Similar to Evenki from the northern branch of Tungusic, the Udege-Oroch languages from the Amur branch exhibit modifier-headed possessor agreement. Oroch examples for this type of adjective attribution marking have already been discussed in Section \ref{ModheadAgr} but will be repeated here.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Oroch} (\citealt[207]{avrorin-etal1967}; \citealt[3]{malchukov2000}) \label{oroch modhead}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll 	nia	\textbf{aja-ni}\\
	man good-\textsc{poss:3sg}\\
\glt	‘a GOOD man’
\ex
\gll nia-sa \textbf{aja-ti}\\	
	man-\textsc{pl} good-\textsc{poss:3pl}\\
\glt	‘GOOD men’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Whereas juxtaposition is the default type of adjective attribution marking in Oroch, modifier-headed possessor agreement occurs only in a special noun phrase type where the adjective is marked for contrastive focus. The special function marked by this construction is to focus on the property denoted by the adjective: ‘a man, a property of whom is “to be good”’ \citep[3]{malchukov2000}. This noun phrase type thus resembles the function of relative clause formation.\footnote{Note also that a similar construction is found in Even from the Northern Tungusic branch where it is only attested with participles: \textit{Beji-l-bu \textbf{hör-če-wut-ten} emu-re-m.} [man-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{acc} go-\textsc{pfct.ptcp}-\textsc{acc}-\textsc{poss:3pl} bring-\textsc{nonfut}-\textsc{1sg}] ‘I brought back the men who had left’ \citep[31]{malchukov1995}.}

\subsubsection{Nanay-Ulcha-Orok}
According to the few grammatical sketches available, the Nanay-Ulcha-Orok languages of Tungusic exhibit juxtaposition as the default device for adjective attribution marking, except Orok.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Orok} Attributive adjectives in Orok (aka Ulta) show agreement in number but not in case (or other categories) with the modified noun.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Orok} \citep[55]{petrova1967}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll \textit{\textbf{dāi}} \textit{dalu(n)}\\
	big store\\
\glt ‘large store (i.e.~warehouse, storehouse)’
\ex 
\gll	\textit{\textbf{dāi-l}} \textit{dalu-l}\\
	big-\textsc{pl} store-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘large stores’
\ex 
\gll	\textit{\textbf{dāi-l}} \textit{dalu-l-tai}\\
	big-\textsc{pl} store-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{loc}\\
\glt	‘in large stores’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Ulcha}
According to \citet[36, 52–53]{sunik1985}, adjectives do not “normally” agree with the modified noun in Ulcha. The language is thus characterized by simple juxtaposition of attributive adjectives.\footnote{\citet[36]{sunik1985} mentions, however, that a few adjectives sometimes show agreement with the modified noun in case and number (according to the simple or the possessive declension (sic!), i.e.~equipped with a possessive suffix) if they are “substantivized”. Unfortunately, he does not provide examples.}

Another adjective attribution marking device mentioned in Sunik's (\citeyear{sunik1985}) grammar is attributive nominalization by means of the suffix \textit{-d\.uma \textasciitilde-dumE}.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Ulcha} \citep[38]{sunik1985}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textit{n'ūči-dumE} ‘a/the little one (among other people)’
\ex \textit{ulEn-dumE} ‘a/the good one (among other people)’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Manchu}
The two Manchu languages Manchu proper and Sibe exhibit juxtaposition as the default adjective attribution marking device similar to the Nanay-Ulcha-Orok languages.

\section{Yukagir} \label{yukagir synchr}
Yukagir (aka Yukaghir) is a small family consisting of the two single languages Tundra Yukagir and Kolyma Yukagir (aka Forest Yukagir)  (\citealt[223]{salminen2007}; \citealt[1–2]{maslova2003a}; \citealt[1]{maslova2003b}).\\

\noindent Noun phrases show strictly head-final word order in both Yukagir languages. True adjective attribution scarcely exists because modifying “property words” in noun phrases are best coded as relative clauses.\\

\noindent The following relevant attribution marking types are attested in Yukagir languages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Incorporation
\item Anti-construct state marking
	\subitem —of “verbal adjectives”
	\subitem —of “nominal adjectives”.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Kolyma Yukagir}
There is no large class of lexical adjectives in Yukagir. The only true adjectives in both Yukagir languages belong to two semantic pairs: ‘small’ : ’big’ and ‘old, ancient’ : ‘new, fresh; (an)other’. The use of adjectives from the first pair is even restricted to a few lexicalized expressions \cite[70–71]{maslova2003b}. It is hard to categorize these adjectives according to their morpho-syntax. \citet[71]{maslova2003b} glosses the lexicalized expressions with the adjectives ‘small’ and ‘big’ as compounds, e.g.~\textit{čom+parnā} [big+crow] ‘raven’. The adjective ‘new’, on the other hand can not only be used in such compounds but can even be marked additionally by the noun attribution suffix \textit{-d} or by the action nominal suffix \textit{-l} \cite[71]{maslova2003b}.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state marking in Kolyma Yukagir}
With the exception of the very small closed class described in the previous section, there are no adjectives in Kolyma Yukagir (\citealt[79–112]{krejnovic1982}, \citealt[66–69, 145–147]{maslova2003b}). All other words denoting qualities constitute a subclass of verbs. Used as attributes these stative verbs take the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular intransitive suffix \mbox{\textit{-j(e)}}.\footnote{Note that this morpheme takes different phonological shapes as the result of allomorphic alternations.} \citet[66, elsewhere]{maslova2003b} describes the inflected finite verbs, as in (\ref{yuk attr}) as “special attributive forms”. Syntactically they have to be analyzed as juxtaposed relative clauses.

\begin{exe}
\ex 	\textsc{Kolyma Yukagir} \citep{maslova2003b}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Attribution \label{yuk attr}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll 	\textbf{kellugī-je} šoromo\\
	lazy-\textsc{attr:intr.3sg} person\\
\glt	‘lazy man (lit. ‘man who is lazy’)’ (146)
\ex
\gll	\textbf{kie-s'e} šoromo\\
	come-\textsc{attr:intr.3sg} person\\
\glt	‘man who comes’ (67)
\end{xlist}
\ex Predication \label{yuk pred}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll 	id'ī pen \textbf{omo-s'}\\
	here it good-\textsc{pred:intr.3sg}\\
\glt	‘this is a nice place (lit. ‘here, it is good’)’ (68)
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Since verbs take different inflectional suffixes depending on their use as predicates or attributes (i.e.~relative clauses, cf.~\ref{yuk attr}+\ref{yuk pred}) the suffix \textit{-j(e)} glossed as \textsc{attr:intr.3sg} can only be analyzed as an anti-construct state marker, i.e.~it constitutes a depend\-ent-marking attribution device which is not connected to noun phrase internal agreement. Even though the marker belongs to the verbal inflection paradigm it is a true licensee of the attributive relationship between a modifying verb phrase (relative clause) and a noun.

Anti-construct state marking in Kolyma Yukagir does not, however, belong to the domain of true adjective attribution marking but is a relative clause marking strategy.\footnote{In order to use a verb as modifier inside a noun phrase, the verb can also be nominalized, e.g.~by means of an action nominal marker: \textit{kel-u-l} [come-0-\textsc{nmlz} ‘(a situation of) coming’ \cite[147]{maslova2003b}, \textit{kel-u-l šoromo} [come-0-\textsc{nmlz} person] ‘(a/the) man who came (i.e.~(a/the) already arrived man)’ \cite[67]{maslova2003b}. This derivational nominalization of verbs to nominals is not considered constituting an adjective attribution marking device either.}

\paragraph{Anti-construct state marking in Tundra Yukagir}
Tundra Yukagir exhibits an anti-construct state marking device of verbs using a relative clause marking strategy similar to Kolyma Yukagir \citep[49–50, elsewhere]{maslova2003a}. In her short grammar, \cite{maslova2003a} mentions the occurrence of a second anti-construct state marking device and gives the following example:
\begin{exe}
\ex 	\textsc{Tundra Yukagir} \citep[50]{maslova2003a}
\gll 	lugu-je(\textbf{-d}) apanalā\\
	very\_old-\textsc{attr:intr.3sg}-\textsc{attr} woman\\
\glt	‘very old woman’
\end{exe}
The use of the marker \textit{-d} is not obligatory and is even restricted to head nouns with vowel-initial stems \cite[50]{maslova2003a}.

Interestingly, the second attribution marking device in Tundra Yukagir is polyfunctional and regularly serves the licensing of nouns (\ref{yuk nounattr}) or noun phrases (\ref{yuk npattr}) as attributes.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Tundra Yukagir} \citep{maslova2003a}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{yuk nounattr}
\gll	iŋli\textbf{-d} igije\\

\glt	‘breast ropes’ (49)
\ex \label{yuk npattr}
\gll	tude kerewe\textbf{-d} ugurt'e\\
	\textsc{3sg} cow-\textsc{attr} legs\\
\glt	‘the legs of his cow’\footnote{The regular use of the cognate attribution marker \textit{-d} (\textit{\textasciitilde-n}) with nouns and noun phrases as attributes is described for Kolyma Yukagir as well. The use of the marker as a licensee of adjective attribution, however, seems to be restricted to one adjective ‘new’ \citep[71]{maslova2003b}.} (44)
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Yeniseian}\label{yeniseian synchr}
\subsection{Northern Yeniseian}
Three branches are reconstructed for the Yeniseian family, but only the Ket language from the northern branch still exists today (\citealt{werner1997a}; \citealt[223]{salminen2007}).\\

\noindent The following adjective attribution marking devices are attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Head-driven agreement
\item Attributive nominalization.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition and head-driven agreement in Ket}
Attributive adjectives in Ket are normally juxtaposed to the left of the noun they modify \cite[38]{vajda2004}. Only a few simple adjective stems describing visible shapes or sizes may optionally take the plural suffix \textit{-ŋ}, as shown in example (\ref{ket agr}). The other morphological features assigned to the noun phrase, i.e.~gender (or class) and case, are not sensitive to syntax in Ket.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Ket} \cite[38]{vajda2004} \label{ket agr}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{qà} quˀŋ\\
	big tent:\textsc{pl}\\
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{qēŋ} quˀŋ\\
	big:\textsc{pl} tent:\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘large tents’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\citet[38]{vajda2004} notes that the optional number agreement marking is “a stylistic device used to emphasize the visual impression created by the quality being described”. Probably, this emphasizing construction marks contrastive focus of the adjective: ‘large tents’ versus ‘LARGE tents’. 

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Ket}
\citet[15, 84–85]{vajda2004} also mentions the nominalizing suffix \textsc{-s} which marks lexical and derived adjectives (\ref{ket adjn nmlz}), noun phrases (\ref{ket np nmlz}), and adpositional phrases (\ref{ket ap nmlz}) as attributes in headless noun phrases.\footnote{Note that the examples (\ref{ket np nmlz} and \ref{ket ap nmlz}) seem to represent phonological compounds. This is evidenced by the phonological reduction in syllable-mediate vowels. The non-nominalized phrases, according to \citet{vajda2005} are \textit{úgda ɔ́lin} ‘a long nose’ and \textit{qō-t-hɯtɯ-ɣa} ‘under the ice [ice-\textsc{gen}-under]’. It is not clear from the description, however, if incorporation is relevant to morpho-syntax as well. But this phenomenon deserves further attention since adjective incorporation is scarcely attested in the world's languages but occurs in a few other non-related branches of the northern Eurasia.}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Ket} \citep{vajda2005}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Nominalized adjective \label{ket adjn nmlz}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	sîn\textbf{-s}\\

\gll	súl-tu\textbf{-s}\\

\end{xlist}
\ex	Nominalized noun phrase \label{ket np nmlz}

\gll	qó-t-{hɯtɯ-ɣa}\textbf{-s}\\
	ice-\textsc{gen}-under-\textsc{nmlz}\\
\glt	‘the one under the ice’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Grammatical descriptions of Ket (\citealt{vajda2004}, cf.~also \citealt{krukova2007}) only give examples where these nominalized (headless) noun phrases are used in apposition, as in the contrastive-focus construction (\ref{ket contrfoc}). 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Ket} \cite{vajda2005} \label{ket contrfoc}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Adjective predication
\gll	bū \textbf{sîn-du} / bū \textbf{sîn-dʌ}\\

\ex	Contrastive-focus construction
\gll	bū \textbf{sîn-s}\\
	3\textsc{sg} old-\textsc{nmlz}\\
\glt	‘he/\-she is OLD (i.e.~‘an old one’)’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The available data does not provide enough evidence for a detailed description and analyses of attributive nominalization by means of the suffix \textit{-s} as a regular attribution marking device in Ket. It it possible that these nominalizations cannot be used as true modifiers of nouns but are restricted to headless noun phrases and are used only in special contrastive-focus constructions.

There is even evidence against the analysis of nominalization as attributive marking in Ket. Vajda's examples of nominalized adverbials suggest that this contrastive-focus marking is used predominantly in copular constructions (as predicates). Since the otherwise regular predicative agreement marking never occurs on these nominalizations \cite[15]{vajda2004} it could also be argued that the nominalizer \textit{-s} constitutes a strategy for secondary predication marking rather than attribution marking.

Attributive nominalization in Ket definitely deserves more attention. The construction might constitute an example of the development of attributive nominalization independent of definiteness marking.

\section{Turkic}
Languages from the Turkic language family are spoken across all of northern Eurasia, including northeastern and southeastern Europe, and beyond. The family is divided into two major branches: Bulgar- and Common Turkic. Where\-as Bulgar Turkic is represented only by one language, the Common Turkic branch can be further divided into nine groups, seven of which have members spoken in northern Eurasia: Oguz, Karluk, Kipchak, Altay Turkic, Yenisey Turkic (Khakas), Sayan Turkic, and Lena Turkic \cite[221]{salminen2007}.\\

\noindent All Turkic languages are characterized by strict head-finality in their noun phrase structure. The prototypical adjective attribution marking device in Turkic languages is juxtaposition. This type occurs as the unmarked construction in all Turkic languages. In some Turkic languages, however, an attributive nominalizer marks an attributive adjective in contrastive-focus constructions. This construction is systematically described (more or less) only for Chuvash from the Bulgar Turkic branch.\\

\noindent The following types of adjective attribution marking are attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Attributive nominalization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bulgar Turkic}
The Bulgar (aka Oghur) subbranch of the Turkic language family is represented only by a single language, Chuvash.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition and attributive nominalization in Chuvash} \label{chuvash synchr}
Similar to all other Turkic languages, Chuvash exhibits juxtaposition as the default and general adjective attribution marking device (\ref{chuvash juxt}). Besides juxtaposition, an attributive nominalizer is used in contrastive-focus constructions (\ref{chuvash attr}).
\begin{exe}
\ex	\textsc{Chuvash} \citep{clark1998a}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 	Juxtaposition \label{chuvash juxt}

\gll	\textbf{χur-i} χut\\					 		
	black-\textsc{attr} paper\\
\glt	‘BLACK paper (not of another color)’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The attributive article \textit{-i} is similar to the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} singular. As in other Turkic languages, this article is also obligatorily used in headless noun phrases marked as direct (accusative) objects in Chuvash.
%Contrastive focus, not definiteness (a black one / the black one

 	black-\textsc{attr}-\textsc{acc} { } red-\textsc{attr}-\textsc{acc} I\_bought\\
\glt 	(Which pen did you buy?) ‘I bought a/the black / red one.’
\end{exe}
Besides \textit{-i}, a second nominalizer \textit{-sker} is attested in Chuvash. Both formatives are used with similar classes of adjectival and other attributes.

\subsection{Common Turkic}
\subsubsection{Oguz}
\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Azerbaijani} Similar to all other Turkic languages, attributive adjectives are simply juxtaposed to the modified noun in Azerbaijani.

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Turkish} \label{turkish synchr}
Similar to other Turkic languages, the article is used obligatorily in headless noun phrases marked as direct (accusative) objects in Turkish. 

\begin{exe}

\end{exe}
 
\subsubsection{Karluk}
The default and general adjective attribution marking device in the languages of the Karluk subbranch of Common Turkic is \textbf{juxtaposition} and is similar to example (\ref{azerb juxt}) from Azerbaijani. Besides juxtaposition, attributive nominalization is also attested.

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Uigur} 
The possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular occurs as an attributive nominalizer in contrastive-focus constructions in Uigur. This construction is thus similar to example (\ref{chuvash attr}) from Chuvash from the Bulgar branch of Turkic.
\begin{exe}

The default and general adjective attribution marking device in the languages of the Lena subbranch of Common Turkic is \textbf{juxtaposition}  and is similar to example (\ref{azerb juxt}) from Azerbaijani.

\section{Nakh-Daghestanian}
The Nakh-Daghestanian family is named after its two main branches: Nakh and Daghestanian. Wheras Nakh comprises only a few single languages, the Daghestanian branch can be further divided into several subbranches \cite[220, 233]{salminen2007}.\\

\noindent The predominant constituent order inside the noun phrase of Nakh-Dagh\-estan\-ian languages is adjective-noun. Regarding the morpho-syntactic licensing of adjective attribution, the Nakh-Daghestanian family is characterized by a relatively high diversity of noun phrase types.\\

\noindent The following adjective attribution marking devices are attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Head-driven agreement marking
\item Anti-construct state agreement marking
\item Anti-construct state marking
\item Attributive nominalization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Daghestanian}

\subsubsection{Avar-Andi-Tsezic}
The Avar-Andi-Tsezic group of Daghestanian is named after three groups of closely related languages: Andi (comprising the languages Akhvakh, Andi, Bagvalal, Botlikh, Chamalal, Godoberi, Karata and Tindi), Tsezic (comprising the languages Tsez (aka Dido), Hinukh, Khvarshi, Inkhokvari, Bezhta (aka Kapucha) and Hunzib. The single language Avar forms the third group of Avar-Andi-Tsezic \citep[220, 233]{salminen2007}.\\

\noindent The prototype of adjective attribution marking in the Avar-Andi-Tsezic languages is head-driven agreement which occurs in all languages of this group.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Godoberi}
The unmarked constituent order in Godoberi is adjective-noun.\footnote{The reversed order marks contrastive focus on the adjective: \textit{hac'a χ°aji} [white dog] ‘white dog’, \textit{χ°aji hac'a} [dog white] ‘that very dog (of several others) which is white’ \citep[149]{kazenin1996a}.} Adjectives agree with the head noun in the features \textsc{gender} (if a position for the class-marker is available) and \textsc{number}.
\begin{exe}

\textit{\textbf{q'arúma-r} hamaχi-be} \textsc{n.pl} ‘greedy donkeys’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Tsez}
In Tsez, two lexical classes of adjectives have to be distinguished. The members of the first class take gender agreement prefixes. The (few) members of the second class are simply juxtaposed to the modified noun \cite[126]{alekseev-etal2004}.

There is an additional attributive marker: the attributive nominalizing suffix \textit{-ni} which marks attributive adjectives in headless noun phrases and also “restrictive” (or definite) forms of the adjective.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Tsez} \citep{alekseev-etal2004}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Nominalized headless adjective
\begin{xlist}
\ex

\glt	‘(this) little boy (and not one of the others) is my brother’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The content of the “restrictive” (aka “definite”) form remains somewhat uncertain. The translation of (\ref{Tsez restr}) in the description of \citet[128]{alekseev-etal2004} resembles contrastive-focus marking (‘the LITTLE boy’).

\subsubsection{Lak}
The Lak subbranch of Daghestanian is formed by one single language: Lak proper.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement marking in Lak}
Constituent order in Lak is adjec\-tive-noun. The language exhibits two adjective attribution marking devices. The unmarked and default attribution marking device is head-driven agreement which characterizes adjectives derived by means of the adjectivizer \mbox{\textit{-ssa}}, as in (\ref{lak hdragr}). These derived adjectives only agree in gender class. Other morpho-syntactic marking is not applied.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Lak} \cite[48]{zirkov1955} \label{lak hdragr}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{uč-ssa} adimina\\
	fat.\textsc{I}-\textsc{adjz} person(\textsc{I})\\
\glt	‘fat man’
\gll	\textbf{b-uč-ssa} nic\\
	\textsc{III}-fat-\textsc{adjz} bull\textsc{(III)}\\
\glt	‘fat bull’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{b-uč-ssa} nic-ru\\
	\textsc{III}-fat-\textsc{adjz} bull\textsc{(III)}-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘fat bulls’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the suffix \textit{-ssa} is a derivational formative rather than a marker of attribution since it occurs on adjectives in attributive and predicative position alike. Predicative adjectives even show similar gender agreement inflection \citep[45–51]{zirkov1955}.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking in Lak}
While head-driven agreement marking, as in (\ref{lak hdragr}), constitutes the basic and unmarked adjective attribution marking device in Lak, anti-construct state agreement marking is restricted to contrastive-focus constructions.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Lak} \citep[45]{zirkov1955}%Seitenzahl falsch
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{uč-ma} adimina\\
	fat.\textsc{I}-\textsc{attr:I} person\textsc{(I)}\\

\ex
\gll	\textbf{b-uč-mur} nic\\

	\textsc{III}-fat-\textsc{attr:pl} bull\textsc{(III)}-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘FAT bulls’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the occurrence of the anti-construct state agreement marking suffixes \textit{-ma, -mur, -mi} is restricted to attributive adjectives. Unlike adjectives with the derivational formative \textit{-ssa} with head-driven agreement marking in number only, contrastive-focused adjectives (occurring in the anti-construct state agreement noun phrase type) show agreement in number as well \citep[45–51]{zirkov1955}.

\subsubsection{Dargwa}
The Dargwa subbranch of Daghestanian consists of one single language (with several sub-varieties): Dargwa proper \cite[233]{salminen2007}.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking and juxtaposition in Dargwa}\hspace{1cm}\\
Darg\-wa exhibits two adjective attribution marking devices. Whereas anti-construct state (number) agreement marking (\ref{dargwa anti}) is the default type, juxtaposition (\ref{dargwa juxt}) is restricted to “poetic language” \citep[318]{isaev2004}.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Dargwa} \citep[318]{isaev2004}

\subsubsection{Lezgian}\label{lezgian synchr}
The Lezgian subbranch of Daghestanian comprises the following languages: Agul, Archi, Badukh, Kryz (aka Kryts), Lezgi, Rutul, Tabasaran, Tsakhur and Udi.\\

\noindent The basic constituent order in the noun phrase of all Lezgian languages is adjective-noun. Regarding their adjective attribution marking, the Lezgian languages exhibit the highest degree of diversity. All types found in Nakh-Daghestanian are attested: Juxtaposition, Head-driven agreement marking, Anti-construct state agreement marking, Anti-construct state marking and Attributive nominalization.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Udi}
The default adjective attribution marking device in Udi is juxtaposition, cf. the following (incomplete) paradigm.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Udi} \citep[465]{schulze-furhoff1994}\\
\textit{\textbf{kala} ĝara-Ø} \textsc{abs} ‘the old son’\\
\textit{\textbf{kala} ĝara-en} \textsc{erg}\\
\textit{\textbf{kala} ĝara-i} \textsc{gen}\\
\dots
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition and head-driven agreement in Tabasaran}
The default adjective attribution marking device in Tabasaran is juxtaposition, as in Udi. Only a minor lexical subclass of two adjectives in this language deviate in this respect and show gender and number agreement.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Tabasaran} \citep[50–51]{kurbanov1986}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll \textit{\textbf{uččvu-r} adaš}\\
	beautiful-\textsc{I} father\textsc{(I)}\\
\glt	‘beautiful father’
\ex 
\gll \textit{\textbf{uččvu-b} gjajvan}\\
	beautiful-\textsc{II} horse\textsc{(II)}\\
\glt	‘beautiful horse’
\ex
\gll \textit{\textbf{uččvu-dar} gjunšjir}\\
	beautiful-\textsc{pl} horse:\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘beautiful horses’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Archi}
Attributive adjectives in Archi show agreement in gender and number with the modified noun; see the complete agreement paradigm for the adjective ‘good’.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Archi} \citep{kibrik1994a}\\
\textit{hibàt̄u} \textsc{I sg} ‘good’\\
\textit{hibàt̄u-r} \textsc{II sg}\\
\textit{hibàt̄u-b} \textsc{III sg}\\
\textit{hibàt̄u-t} \textsc{IV sg}\\
\textit{hibàt̄-ib} \textsc{pl}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking in Tsakhur}
Adjectives in Tsa\-khur can be divided into three subclasses according to their choice of attribution marking devices. The first, minor lexical class of adjectives in Tsakhur is characterized by missing inflection. Adjectives belonging to this class are simply juxtaposed to the modified noun \citep[383]{talibov2004}. Members of the two other adjective classes exhibit anti-construct state agreement marking.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Tsakhur} \citep[382]{talibov2004}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	\label{tsakhur gen}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Gender class I–III
\gll	\textbf{bat'raj-na} jis / dix̌ / balk\textsuperscript{h}an\\
	 beautiful-\textsc{attr:I–III} girl(\textsc{I}) { } son(\textsc{II}) { } horse(\textsc{III})\\
\glt	 ‘beautiful girl / son / horse’
\ex	Gender class IV
\gll	\textbf{bat'raj-n}	č'alag\\
	beautiful-\textsc{attr:IV} forest(\textsc{IV})\\
\glt	‘beautiful forest’
\end{xlist}
\ex \label{tsakhur attrgen}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Gender class I
\gll	\textbf{x̌\underline{a}rna} jis\\
	big:\textsc{attr:I–III} mother(\textsc{I})\\
\glt	‘old mother (=grandmother)’
\ex	Gender class IV
\gll	\textbf{x̌adɨn} balag\\
	big:\textsc{attr:IV} sack(\textsc{IV})\\
\glt	‘big sack’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Whereas the anti-construct agreement marker of adjectives from the first group (\ref{tsakhur gen}) is formally identical with the genitive case suffixes of nouns, adjectives from the second group (\ref{tsakhur attrgen}) are equipped with a morphologically complex formative including the genitive suffix and a phonological stem alternation \citep[382]{talibov2004}.
%bei \cite{schulze1997} noch sehr interessante Sachen zum "Genitiv-Attributive"

\paragraph{Nominalization in headless noun phrases in Udi}
The default adjective attribution marking device in Udi is head-driven agreement. In headless noun phrases, however, attributive adjectives are obligatorily nominalized by means of the stem augment \textit{-o-} \textsc{abs} / \textit{-t'-} \textsc{obl}.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Udi} \citep[466]{schulze-furhoff1994}\\
\textit{kala-o} \textsc{nmlz.abs} ‘the big/old one’\\
\textit{kala-o-r} \textsc{nmlz.abs}-\textsc{pl}\\
\textit{kala-t'-in} \textsc{nmlz:obl}-\textsc{erg}\\
\textit{kala-t'-ĝ-on} \textsc{nmlz:obl}-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{erg}\\
\textit{kala-t'-ay} \textsc{nmlz:obl}-\textsc{gen}\\
\dots
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Nominalization in headless noun phrases in Lezgi}
Attributive adjectives in headless noun phrases are nominalized in Lezgi as well. The nominalizing suffix exhibits different forms in the Absolute singular case (\textit{-di}), in the oblique cases (\textit{-da}) and in plural (\textit{-bur}).
\begin{exe}
\ex Headless adjectives in \textsc{Lezgi} \citep[110]{haspelmath1993}\\
\textit{q̃acu-di} \textsc{attr:sg} ‘green one’\\
\textit{q̃acu-da} \textsc{attr:erg.sg}\\
\textit{q̃acu-da-n} \textsc{attr}-\textsc{gen}\\
\textit{q̃acu-bur} \textsc{attr:pl}\\
\textit{q̃acu-bur-u} \textsc{attr:pl}-\textsc{erg}\\
\dots
\end{exe}
The same attribution marker is also used for the nominalization of noun phrases.
\begin{exe}
\ex Nominalized noun phrases in \textsc{Lezgi} \citep[110]{haspelmath1993}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\begin{xlist}
\ex\textit{zi} \textsc{poss:1sg} ‘my’
\ex \textit{zi\textbf{-di}} \textsc{poss:1sg}-\textsc{attr} ‘mine’
\end{xlist}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textit{dide.di-n} mother-\textsc{gen} ‘mother's’
\ex \textit{dide.di-n\textbf{-di}} mother-\textsc{gen}-\textsc{attr} ‘mother's’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Even though adjectives without a lexical head in Udi and Lezgi are nominalized there is no evidence that these nominalizations serve as attribution marking devices.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state marking in Rutul}
In Rutul, attributive and predicative adjectives are differentiated by means of two different derivations. Whereas attributive adjectives take an anti-construct suffix \textit{-d \textasciitilde-dɨ}\footnote{The allomorph \textit{-dɨ} occurs after consonants \citep[224]{alekseev1994a}.} predicative adjectives take a suffix \textit{-ɨ \textasciitilde-ɨ}\footnote{The allomorph \textit{-ɨ} occurs after dorsal consonants \citep[224]{alekseev1994a}.} or are not marked at all \citep[224]{alekseev1994a}.

Attributive adjectives do not inflect other than by means of anti-construct state marking.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Rutul} \citep[237]{alekseev1994a}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{äkkà-d} dahàr\\
	big-\textsc{attr} stone\\
\glt	‘big stone’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{äkkà-d} dahàr-bɨr\\
	big-\textsc{attr} stone-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘big stones’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the anti-construct state marker \textit{-d \textasciitilde-dɨ} is identical to the Genitive case of nouns and thus constitutes a polyfunctional marker \cite{alekseev1994a}.

\subsection{Nakh}
The Nakh branch of Nakh-Daghestanian comprises only three languages: Bats, Ingush and Chechen. The latter two form a common subbranch \citep[220, 233]{salminen2007}.\\

\noindent The noun phrase structure in all three languages is basically similar. Attributive adjectives precede the modified noun and show head-driven agreement. Headless adjectives are additionally marked with an attributive nominalizer.

\subsection{Chechen-Ingush}\label{ingush synchr}
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Ingush}
Attributive adjectives in Ingush agree in case with the modified noun. The adjective agreement paradigm, however, exhibits only a single case distinction of nominative versus oblique.
\begin{exe}
\ex Case agreement paradigm in \textsc{Ingush} \citep[99]{nichols1994b}\\
\textit{\textbf{joqqa} jurt} \textsc{nom} ‘large village’\\
\textit{\textbf{joqqa-ča} jurt-a} \textsc{gen}\\
\textit{\textbf{joqqa-ča} jurt-aa} \textsc{dat}\\
\textit{\textbf{joqqa-ča} jurt-uo} \textsc{erg}\\
\textit{\textbf{joqqa-ča} jurt-aca} \textsc{ins}\\
\dots \label{ingush agr}
\end{exe}
Some adjectives also show agreement in gender; but only very few adjectives additionally agree in number with the modified noun \citep[99]{nichols1994b}.

\paragraph{Nominalization in headless noun phrases in Chechen}
Beside head-driven agreement, Che\-chen (similar to the other Nakh languages) exhibits attributive nominalization as a regular adjective attribution marking device in headless noun phrases. The formative is a thematic stem extension merged with the case inflection.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Chechen} \citep[29]{nichols1994a}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	leqa kert\\
	high fence\\
\glt	‘high fence’
\ex	
\gll	leqa\textbf{-nig}\\
	high-\textsc{attr:nom.sg}\\
\glt	‘the high one’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Even though adjectives without a lexical head in Chechen are nominalized, there is no evidence that these nominalizations serve as attribution marking devices.

\subsection{Bats}
The noun phrase structure in Bats (aka Tsova-Tush or Batsbi) is similar to the structure found in closely related Chechen and Ingush. Attributive adjectives show \textbf{head-driven agreement}. Headless adjectives are additionally marked by means of \textbf{nominalization} \cite[172–172]{holisky-etal1994}. 

\section{Abkhaz-Adyge}
The Abhaz-Adyge (aka Northwest-Caucasian) family consists of the two branches Abkhaz and Adyge (aka Adyghe or Circassian) each of which comprises two languages. A third branch, Ubykh, is now extinct \citep[220, 233]{salminen2007}.\\

\noindent Whereas the adjective-noun constituent order is similar in all Abkhaz-Adyge languages, the prototypes of adjective attribution marking devices
\begin{itemize}
\item Head-driven agreement (Abkhaz)
\item Incorporation (Adyge)
\end{itemize}
occurring in the two branches of this family deviate considerably.

\subsection{Abkhaz}
The Abkhaz branch of Abhaz-Adyge comprises the two very closely related varieties Abkhaz and Abaza. The constituent order inside the noun phrase of both languages is normally noun-adjective. Only adjectives denoting nationality deviate from this rule and precede the modified noun \citep[222]{comrie1981}.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Abkhaz}
%WO = noun-adjective %aber nationality = A N %A N auch bei einigen anderen möglich
Attributive adjectives in Abkhaz show number agreement.\footnote{Noun phrases with an attributive adjective following a non-inflected noun in Abkhaz have alternatively been analyzed as polysynthetic constructions (hence adjective incorporation), e.g.~by \citet[123]{rijkhoff2002} and \citet{gil2005}.} Note, however, that a plural noun modified by an adjective may remain unmarked \citep[46]{hewitt1989a}. Even though the plural marker may attach only once at the right phrase edge, it is best analyzed as an agreement marker and not a clitic. This is evidenced by the fact that the adjective may take the non-human pluralizer even if it modifies a human noun.\footnote{Note that in the closely related language Abaza, plural marking occurs twice but the non-human pluralizer constitutes the obligatory plural agreement marker on adjectives modifying nouns of any gender class \cite[100]{lomtatidze-etal1989}.}
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Abkhaz} \citep{hewitt1989a}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	a-là(-k°à) \textbf{bzə̀ya-k°a}\\

	\textsc{def}-girl-\textsc{pl:hum} good-\textsc{pl:nonhum} {} good-\textsc{pl:hum}\\
\glt	‘the good girl’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Adyge}
The Adyge (aka Adyghe or Circassian) branch of Abkhaz-Adyge comprises the two languages Adyge proper and Karbardian. Both languages exhibit similar noun phrase structures. The constituent order inside the noun phrase is normally noun-adjective. Noun phrases with modifying adjectives in Adyge and Karbardian are often described as single compound words \citep[222]{comrie1981}.

\paragraph{Adjective incorporation in Karbardian}
Attributive adjectives in Karbardian (aka East-Circassian or Karbard-Cherkes) occur in a polysynthetic structure to the right of the modified noun. Number and case inflection of the noun phrase is suffixed to the adjective.

\section{Kartvelian}\label{kartvelian synchr}
Kartvelian is a language family comprising the four languages Georgian, Svan, Laz and Mingrelian (aka Megrelian or Iverian). The latter two languages constitute a common subranch inside the family \cite[220]{salminen2007}. Kartvelian languages are all spoken in the southern Caucasus, mainly in Georgia but also in adjacent countries.\\

\noindent In the modern Kartvelian languages, the unmarked word order of adjectival modifiers and head is noun-final, although the opposite order is also possible \citep[56]{harris1991a}.\\

\noindent Three adjective attribution marking types are attested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Head-driven agreement
\item Appositional head-driven agreement.
\end{itemize}
The inherited Common Kartvelian agreement marking, however, is more or less preserved only in the marked (but inherited) head-initial noun phrase type. In the head-final noun phrase type, on the other hand, the modern Kartvelian languages display a strong tendency to lose head-driven agreement. Preposed attributive adjectives in Mingrelian and Laz are juxtaposed to the head noun as a rule. In Modern Georgian and Svan, the agreement paradigm of preposed attributive adjectives shows a high degree of syncretism.

\subsection{Georgian}\label{georgian synchr}
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Georgian}
The only agreement feature in Modern Georgian is \textsc{case}. Note, however, that the adjective agreement paradigm exhibits only three differentiated forms.\footnote{In the marked head-initial constituent order of noun and adjective which is used in archaic style or for emphasis, case agreement is complete \citep[59]{tuite1998}.}
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Georgian} \cite[236]{aronson1991}\\
\textit{\textbf{ʒvel-i} c'ign-i} \textsc{nom} ‘old book’\\
\textit{\textbf{ʒvel-ma} c'ign-ma} \textsc{erg}\\
\textit{\textbf{ʒvel-Ø} c'ign-s} \textsc{dat}\\
\textit{\textbf{ʒvel-i} c'ign-is} \textsc{gen}\\
\textit{\textbf{ʒvel-i} c'ign-it} \textsc{ins}\\
\textit{\textbf{ʒvel-Ø} c'ign-ad} \textsc{adv}\\
\dots \label{georgian old}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Georgian}
Whereas the so-called consonantal-stem adjectives like ‘old’ in example (\ref{georgian old}) show head-driven agreement there is another lexical class of adjectives (characterized by a stem-final vowel, hence “vocalic-stem adjectives”), the members of which are simply juxtaposed to the modified noun.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Georgian} \cite[236]{aronson1991}\\
\textit{\textbf{parto} gza} \textsc{nom} ‘wide road’\\
\textit{\textbf{parto} gza-m} \textsc{erg}\\
\textit{\textbf{parto} gza-s} \textsc{dat}\\
\textit{\textbf{parto} gz-is} \textsc{gen}\\
\textit{\textbf{parto} gz-it} \textsc{ins}\\
\textit{\textbf{parto} gz-ad} \textsc{adv}\\
\dots
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Appositional head-driven agreement in Georgian}
Appositional modification seems to occur as a secondary type of adjective attribution marking in Georgian. Attributive adjectives are normally preposed and show only limited agreement (\ref{georgian unmarked}). In postposition (marking emphasis), however, the adjective inflects for the full set of cases and numbers (\ref{georgian marked}). This construction thus resembles an independent (headless) noun phrase in apposition to the semantic head (\citealt[652, 677]{testelec1998}; cf.~also below Section \ref{georgian synchr}). The construction probably marks contrastive focus of the adjective.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Georgian} (<Kartvelian; \citealt[652]{testelec1998})
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{georgian unmarked}
\gll	am or \textbf{lamaz} kal-s\\
	that:\textsc{obl} two nice:\textsc{obl} woman-\textsc{dat}\\
\glt	‘to those two nice women’
\ex \label{georgian marked}
\gll	kal-eb-s \textbf{lamaz-eb-s}\\
	woman-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{dat} nice-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{dat}\\
\glt	‘to the NICE women’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Svan}
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Svan}
Attributive adjectives in Svan show limited agreement in case. The paradigm of the agreement marker exhibits only two members: one for nominative and one for the oblique cases.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Svan} \cite[18]{tuite1997}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll 	\textbf{luwzer-e}	ma:r-e\\
	diligent-\textsc{nom} man-\textsc{nom}\\
\glt	‘a diligent man’
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{luwzer-a}	ma:re:m-i(s\&) (nas\&dabw)\\
	diligent-\textsc{obl} man-\textsc{gen} work\\
\glt	‘(the work) of a diligent man’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\citet[499]{schmidt1991}, however, describes the tendency in Svan to abolish agreement completely and use an uninflected variant of the attributive adjective in the oblique cases instead.

\subsection{Zan}
Zan is a subbranch of Kartvelian formed by the two languages Mingrelian and Laz. The default type of adjective attribution marking in both languages is juxtaposition which occurs obligatorily in the unmarked head-final noun phrase. In the marked head-initial noun phrase, however, attributive adjectives normally agree in number and case with the head noun.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition and head-driven agreement in Mingrelian}
The two adjective attribution marking devices occurring in Zan languages are illustrated with Mingrelian examples.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Mingrelian} \citep[361–364]{harris1991b}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Juxtaposition \label{mingrelian juxt}
\gll	\textbf{skvam} cira-en-k\\

\ex 	Head-driven agreement \label{mingrelian agr}
\gll	cira-en-k \textbf{skvam-en-k}\\
	girl-\textsc{pl}(-\textsc{nar}) beautiful-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{nar}\\
\glt	‘BEAUTIFUL girl’\footnote{Note that the case marking formative does not obligatorily occur on both constituents in the marked head-initial noun phrase in Mingrelian \citep[363–364]{harris1991b}.}%clitic%keiner hat behauptet, das sei kontrastiver fokus
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Semitic}
Semitic languages are only marginally represented in northern Eurasia. The few languages considered here belong either to the Arabic subbranch of Central Semitic or to Northwest-Semitic.\\

\noindent Only one type of adjective attribution marking is attested in these two branches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Head-driven agreement.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Northwest-Semitic}
The only language of the northwestern branch of Semitic considered in the present survey is Assyrian (aka Neo-Aramaic). The language is spoken in the Middle-East in north-western Iran and south-eastern Turkey, but also in adjacent areas of the Caucasus in Azerbaijan, and therefore falls into the geographic area of investigation.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Assyrian}
Constituent order inside the noun phrase of Assyrian is noun-adjective. Attributive adjectives agree with the modified noun in gender and number.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Assyrian (Kurdistan)} \citep{krotkoff1982}\\
\textit{ya:la \textbf{zu:ra}} ‘small boy’\\
\textit{bra:ta \textbf{zurta}} ‘small girl’\\
\textit{bnu:ne \textbf{zu:re}} ‘small kids’
\end{exe}

\subsection{Central Semitic}		
\subsubsection{Arabic}
Cypriote Arabic (aka Kormakiti) and Maltese are two Arabic languages of the Central Semitic branch spoken on the Mediterranean islands Cyprios and Malta, and thus belong to Europe geographically.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Maltese}
The basic and unmarked constituent order in Maltese is noun-adjective. A few adjectives, however, can precede the noun in an emphatic construction \citep[71]{borg-etal1996}.

Adjectives show distinct forms for gender and number in accordance with the morphological features of the modified noun.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Maltese} \citep[328]{aquilina1959}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	ra:jel \textbf{sabi:ħ}\\
	man beautiful:\textsc{m:sg}\\
\glt	‘beautiful man’
\ex
\gll	mara \textbf{sabi:ħa}\\
	woman beautiful:\textsc{f:sg}\\
\glt	‘beautiful woman’
\ex
\gll	nies \textbf{sbieħ}\\
	people beautiful:\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘beautiful people’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Optionally, the attributive adjective can additionally be marked for definiteness. \begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Maltese} \citep[330]{aquilina1959} 
\gll	il-ktieb \textbf{(il-)qadi:m}\\
	\textsc{def}-book	(\textsc{def-})old\\
\glt	‘the old book’
\end{exe}
Even though the construction with a repeated definite marker resembles attributive nominalization it is best analyzed as agreement in the \textsc{definite} value of the feature \textsc{species} \citep[179]{himmelmann1997}. Himmelmann compares the construction in Maltese to Standard Arabic where similar definite (and indefinite) agreement occurs.

\section{Uralic}\label{uralic synchr}
The Uralic language family comprises the branches (roughly from West to East): Hungarian, Saami, Finnic, Permic, Mari, Mordvin, Khanty, Mansi, Samo\-yed \cite[216–218]{salminen2007}. Except for most languages from the Samoyedic subbranch of the family, Uralic languages are all spoken in Europe. Uralic is thus one of the major families on the European linguistic map.\\

\noindent The constituent order inside the noun phrase is strict adjective-initial in all Uralic languages. Similar to Mongolic, Turkic and many other languages of northern Asia, the prototypical adjective attribution marking device in Uralic languages is juxtaposition. This type occurs as the unmarked construction in all Uralic languages with exception of the two western branches Saamic and Finnic which have abandoned juxtaposition and developed new types.

Secondary adjective attribution marking devices are also attested in languages of the Permic and Mari (and probably also other) branches of Uralic, even though juxtaposition is used in these languages as the default strategy for adjective attribution marking.\\

\noindent The following five adjective attribution marking devices occur in Uralic:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Head-driven agreement
\item Anti-construct state marking
\item Appositive head-driven agreement
\item Attributive nominalization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Samoyedic}

\subsubsection{Enets}
The two languages Forest and Tundra Enets constitute the Enets branch of Uralic.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Forest Enets}
In both Enets languages, attributive adjectives are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Forest Enets} (Florian Siegl, pc) \label{enets juxt}
\begin{xlist}
\ex

\ex 
\gll	\textbf{aga} to-xin\\
	large lake\textsc{-loc:pl}\\
\glt	‘in a/the large lakes’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Nenets}
The two languages Forest and Tundra Nenets constitute the Nenets branch of Uralic.

Attributive adjectives in both Nenets languages are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsubsection{Nganasan}
The Nganasan branch of Uralic consists only of one language: Nganasan proper.

\noindent Attributive adjectives are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsubsection{Selkup}
The Selkup branch of Uralic consists of the three three very closely related languages Northern, Central, Southern Selkup.
%aber nur eine betrachtet

\noindent Attributive adjectives in the Selkup languages are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsection{Khanty}
The two languages Northern and Eastern Khanty constitute the Khanty branch of Uralic. A third language Southern Khanty is extinct \citep[231]{salminen2007}.
%aber nur eine betrachtet

\noindent Attributive adjectives in the Khanty languages are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsection{Mansi}
The Mansi branch of Uralic consists of the two very closely related Northern and Eastern Mansi. Two other Mansi languages, Western and Southern Mansi, are extinct \citep[231]{salminen2007}.
%aber nur eine betrachtet

\noindent Attributive adjectives in the Mansi languages are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsection{Hungarian}
The Hungarian branch of Uralic consists only of one language: Hungarian proper.%The outlying dialect Csángó Hungarian spoken in Romania is not considered as distinct language here.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Hungarian}
In Hungarian, attributive adjectives are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Hungarian} \citep[41]{hall1938} \label{hung juxt}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	a \textbf{fekete} szem\\
	\textsc{def} black eye\\

\ex
\gll	a \textbf{fekete} szem-eid\\
	\textsc{def} black eye-\textsc{pl:poss:2sg}\\
\glt	‘your black eyes’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Mari}
The Mari branch of Uralic is formed by the two closely related languages Western Mari (aka Hill Mari) and Eastern Mari (aka Meadow Mari) \citep[231]{salminen2007}.

\noindent Attributive adjectives in the Mari languages are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsection{Mordvin}
The Mordvin branch of Uralic is formed by the two closely related languages Erzya and Moksha \citep[231]{salminen2007}.

\noindent Attributive adjectives in the Mordvin languages are juxtaposed to the modified noun by default, similar to examples (\ref{enets juxt}) from Forest Enets and (\ref{hung juxt}) from Hungarian.

\subsection{Permic}
All three Permic languages Komi-Permyak, Komi-Zyrian and Udmurt exhibit two distinct types of adjective attribution marking. The default type is juxtaposition, which is the inherited proto-Uralic type \citep[80–81]{decsy1990}. However, an attributive nominalization device is used in con\-tras\-tive-focus constructions as a second type.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Komi-Zyrian}
The unmarked sequence of adjective and noun, i.e.~juxtaposition, is illustrated by an example from Komi-Zyrian.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Komi-Zyrian} \citep[287]{lytkin1966a}
\begin{xlist} 
\ex
\gll 		\textbf{bur} 	mort\\
		good	person\\
\glt		‘good person’
\ex
\gll		\textbf{bur}	mort-jas\\
		good	person-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt		‘good people’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization + appositive head-driven agreement in Udmurt} \label{udmurt synchr}
In Udmurt, an attributive nominalizer homophone with the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person possessive inflection marker is regularly used as an adjective attribution marking device in contrastive-focus constructions. Historically, both formatives are similar (cf.~Section \ref{udmurt diachr} in Part \ref{part diachr}).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Udmurt} \citep{winkler2001}
\begin{xlist}

	big house-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{ill}\\
\glt	‘to large house/s’
\end{xlist}

	big-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{ill}-\textsc{attr} house-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{ill}\\
\glt	‘to LARGE house/s’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
An adjective equipped with the nominalizer is also marked with (agreeing) case and number suffixes indicating that the nominalized adjective occurs in an attributive appositional construction. Note that the nominalizer also serves as licensee of adjectival (and other) modification in headless noun phrases.
\begin{exe}
\ex Nominalization in \textsc{Udmurt} \citep{winkler2001}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Adjective 
\gll	badǯ́ym\textbf{-ėz}\\
	big-\textsc{attr}\\
\glt	 ‘the big one’
\ex Demonstrative
\gll	taiz\textbf{-ėz}\\
 	\textsc{dem:dist}-\textsc{attr}\\
\glt	‘that one over there’
\ex Possessor noun phrase
\gll	Ivan-len\textbf{-ėz}\\
	Ivan-\textsc{gen}-\textsc{attr}\\
	 ‘that one of Ivan's’
\end{xlist}
\ex Contrastive focused attribute
\begin{xlist}
\ex Demonstrative \label{attr demnmlz}
\gll	taiz\textbf{-ėz} gurt\\
 	\textsc{dem:dist}-\textsc{attr} house\\
\glt	‘THAT (particular) house over there’
\ex Possessor noun phrase \label{attr npnmlz}
\gll	Ivan-len\textbf{-ėz} gurt\\
	Ivan-\textsc{gen}-\textsc{attr} house\\
	 ‘IVAN'S house (and not someone else's)’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Examples (\ref{attr demnmlz} through \ref{attr npnmlz}) show that attributive nominalization in Udmurt is a true attribution marking device which is polyfunctional and not restricted to headless noun phrases.

Note that the attributive article is normally labeled “determinative suffix” (or in similar terms) in the Udmurt (and Uralic) grammatical tradition. This label probably originates from the formative's function as a ”quasi-definite marker”. But “determinative” inflection is obligatory only in the case of differential object marking with the marked versus the unmarked accusative. Note also that the “definite” (marked) accusative suffix, again, is historically identical with the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person.%check Orthographie
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex Differential object marking in \textsc{Udmurt} \citep[22]{winkler2001}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	mon kniga lɨdǯ́-i\\
	\textsc{1sg} book(\textsc{acc}) read-\textsc{1sg.pst}\\
\glt	‘I have read a book.’
\ex	
\gll	mon (ta) kniga\textbf{-jez} lɨdǯ́-i\\
	\textsc{1sg} this book-\textsc{acc} read-\textsc{1sg.pst}\\
\glt	‘I have read the (i.e.~‘this certain’) book.’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note even that in these and similar examples, the concept of definiteness does not always coincide with the use of the “(in-)definite accusative” marking. According to \citet[21]{winkler2001} “the marked accusative is used if the object itself is focused, whereas the unmarked is employed if the action itself bears the logical accent.” Accordingly, even such occurrences of the “determinative suffix” thus resemble focus marking rather than definiteness marking.

Even though contrastive focus inflection of nouns is the result of purely morphological (morpho-semantic) assignment, contrastive focus inflection of adjectives can only be analyzed as a morpho-syntactic feature. This is evidenced by the agreement pattern: Whereas adjectives in non-contrasted (unmarked) constructions are simply juxtaposed to the head noun, contrastive focused adjectives normally show head-driven number agreement.\footnote{The different order of morphemes in certain members of contrastive focus inflection paradigms (i.e.~number-, case-, and (former) possessive suffix) as compared to the historically similar “regular” possessive inflection \citep[32]{winkler2001} is not of concern here. This phenomenon does, however, provide evidence for the analysis of the contrastive focus marker of adjectives and the possessive marker of nouns as two different formatives from a synchronic point of view.} Agreement marking on the adjective is clearly assigned by syntax, the head noun being the agreement trigger and the attributive (and contrastive-focused) adjective being the agreement target.

Attributive marking in contrastive-focus constructions in Udmurt (and the other Permic languages) is similar in theory to prototypical anti-construct state agreement marking in languages like Russian, with regard to both synchrony and diachrony. The construction is still analyzed as attributive nominalization because the agreement marking on the nominalized attribute is the indirect result of the attributive appositional construction and the nominalizing and agreement formatives are not fused synchronically.

\paragraph{Appositive head-driven agreement in Udmurt}
Note, however, that in Udmurt, number agreement also sometimes occurs without the contrastive-focus marker.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex Head-driven plural agreement in \textsc{Udmurt}

\ex 
\gll	badǯ́ym-eš́ gurt-jos\\

	wide-\textsc{pl} street-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘WIDE streets’  \citep[63]{csucs1990}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
According to \citet[63]{csucs1990} head-driven agreement marking in constructions without the “determinative suffix” is the result of analogy. The fact that their use is still restricted to contrastive-focus constructions, and is therefore an appositional attribution marking device, is crucial for the analysis as appositive head-driven agreement (as opposed to true head-driven agreement).

\subsection{Finnic}
The Finnic (aka Fennic or Baltic Finnic) branch of Uralic comprises the following languages: Livonian, Estonian, Votic, Finnish, Ingrian, Karelian, Lude, Veps.\\
%(+Võro)(+Meänkieli+Kveeni)(+Olonetsian)

\noindent The Finnic branch is exceptional among Uralic in that all of its member languages regularly exhibit head-driven agreement as the regular type of adjective attribution marking.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Finnish} \label{finnish synchr}
The morphological features assigned to the head noun in Finnish are passed on to its adjectival (and other) modifiers. Finnish adjectives thus show a prototypical instance of head-driven agreement. 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Finnish} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{iso} talo\\
	big house\\
\glt	‘large house’
\ex	\label{fin num}
\gll	\textbf{iso-t} talo-t\\
	big-\textsc{pl} house-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘large houses’
\ex	\label{fin case}
\gll	\textbf{iso-i-ssa}	talo-i-ssa\\
	big-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{iness} house-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{iness}\\
\glt	‘in large houses’
\ex 	\label{fin poss}
\gll	\textbf{iso} (* iso-ni) talo-ni\\
	big {} house-\textsc{poss:1sg} house-\textsc{poss:1sg}\\
\glt	‘my large house’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note, however, that not all morphological features assign their values to the attributive adjective in Finnish. Whereas number (\ref{fin num}) and case marking (\ref{fin case}) are assigned to the adjective, possessive marking (\ref{fin poss}) is not.

\subsection{Saamic} \label{saami synchr}
Saamic languages are spoken on the Scandinavian peninsula in north-central Norway and Sweden as well as in northern Finland and on the Kola peninsula in northwestern-most Russia. Saamic branches further into an eastern and a western group.\\

\noindent The Saamic languages are exceptional among Uralic and the languages of most other families of Europe in that they exhibit an invariable attributive suffix on adjectives. In Section \ref{dep-marking state} of Part \ref{part typ}, this noun phrase type was characterized as \textit{dependent-marked attributive state}; the respective formative is labeled \textit{anti-construct state marker}. Note, however that the regular use of this inflectional category of adjectives varies across different Saamic languages.

\subsubsection{East-Saamic}
The four living East-Saamic languages Ter, Kildin, Skolt and Inari Saami are spoken on the Kola peninsula in northwestern-most Russia and in the adjacent parts of northern Finland.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state marking in Skolt Saami}
Prototypically, the anti-con\-struct marking suffix in Saamic languages has the shape \textit{-(V)s \textasciitilde-(V)s'}.\footnote{The palatalized variant occurs in the East-Saamic languages Ter, Skolt, and Kildin.} The suffix is found in all Saamic languages (\citealt{riesler2006b}; see also Section \ref{saamic diachr} where the origin of attributive state marking in Saamic will be dealt with in detail). 

In Skolt Saami, the prototypical pairs of predicative and attributive adjective forms are equipped with the suffixes \textit{-(â)d} \textsc{pred} and \textit{-(e)s'} \textsc{attr} respectively.\footnote{The Notozero dialect of Skolt Saami is spoken on the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Note that the orthographical transcription of the Skolt Saami examples is my own and does not follow the official orthography adapted for the major varieties of Skolt Saami in Finland.} Whereas the suffix \textit{-âd} in example (\ref{skolt pred}) marks the predicative state of the adjective, the suffix \textit{-es'} is an attributive state marker. The examples (\ref{skolt attr}) show that the formative is invariable and does not alter its form in a plural or case marked noun phrase.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Skolt Saami (Notozero)} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Predicative \label{skolt pred}

	beautiful-\textsc{attr} girl-\textsc{gen.pl} house\\
\glt	‘the house of the beautiful girls’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
In all Saamic languages, attributive (and predicative) state marking of adjectives is complex and determined by certain lexically defined classes and subclasses of adjectives. Many adjectives are marked only for attributive state but show the unmarked stem form in the predicative form. Consider for instance \textit{neurr'} \textsc{pred} versus \textit{nēur'-es'} \textsc{attr} ‘bad’. In addition, in the predicative forms of several adjectives, suffixes other than \textit{-(â)d} also occur. Finally, there are a few adjectives which also uses the attributive suffix in their predicative forms.

A general tendency is noticeable in all Saamic languages: the differentiated morphological marking of predicative and attributive adjectives is being abolished in favor of using the pure or extended stem forms in both syntactic positions. As a result, attributive state marking seems to be in dissolution. Several classes of adjectives, however, do not seem to be as affected by the functional spread of the juxtapositional type. In Skolt Saami, the anti-construct state marker is even used productively in several derived adjective classes, such as with the abessive adjectivizer.
\begin{exe}
\ex Derived adjectives in \textsc{Skolt Saami} \citep[279]{senkevic-g1968}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{pārn'-eht'em'-es'} nezzan\\
	child-\textsc{abess.adjz-attr} woman\\
\glt	‘(a) woman without children’
\ex
\gll 	taht nezzan lij \textbf{pārn'-eht'em}\\
	this woman is child-\textsc{abess.adjz}\\
\glt	‘this woman is without children’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Skolt Saami}
Whereas dependent-marked attributive state is the prototypical type of adjective attribution marking in Skolt (as well as in the other Saamic languages), certain adjectives are never inflected in their attributive form, one instance is \textit{nuorr} ‘young’.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Skolt Saami (Notozero)} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll 	taht lij \textbf{nuorr} niejdd\\
	this is young girl\\
\glt	‘this is a beautiful girl’
\ex	
\gll	tegke liev \textbf{nuorr} niejjd\\
	this are young girl$\backslash$\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘these are beautiful girls’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The noun phrase type in which ‘young’ and other members of this adjectival class occur must be characterized as {juxtaposition}. Hence, Skolt Saami exhibits a second, minor adjective attribution marking device in addition to attributive state marking.

\subsubsection{West-Saamic}
The five West-Saamic languages North, Lule, Pite, Ume and South Saami are spoken in northern Norway and Sweden and in the adjacent parts of northern Finland.\\

\noindent The default adjective attribution marking device in all West-Saamic languages is anti-construct state marking, just as in East-Saamic. Only a few adjectives are attributed by means of other devices.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Northern Saami}
Anti-construct state marking is the default device for attribution marking in all Saamic languages. A few adjectives, however, often show partial agreement with the head noun in number and case. In Northern Saami, the adjective ‘good’ and sometimes also the adjective ‘bad’ follow this type.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Northern Saami} \citep[83]{nickel1990}\\
\textit{buorre niibi} [good(\textsc{nom:sg}) knive(\textsc{nom:sg})] ‘good knive’\\

\end{exe}

\section{Indoeuropean}
Indoeuropean is among the world's language families with the largest geographic distribution. Most of the European languages belong to that family. But Indoeuropean languages are spoken as far East as on the Indic subcontinent. The family can be divided into nine branches \cite[218]{salminen2007}, all of which are represented in the present investigation.\\

\noindent The prototype of adjective attribution marking in the Indoeuropean languages is head-driven agreement. This type is also reconstructed for proto-Indoeuro\-pean \citep{decsy1991,watkins1998}. Due to the development of certain secondary types of adjective attribution marking devices, however, divergence is relatively high inside the Indoeuropean family. Furthermore, in several bran\-ches of Indoeuropean, head-driven agreement has been lost in favor of different other types of attribution marking (as will be shown in Part \ref{part diachr}).\\

\noindent Among the languages of northern Eurasia, the Indoeuropean family exhibits the highest diversity with regard to the number of possible adjective attribution marking devices. The following types are attested in different Indoeuropean languages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Juxtaposition
\item Head-driven agreement
\item Construct-state marking
\item Anti-construct state marking
\item Anti-construct state agreement marking
\item Attributive nominalization
\item Incorporation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Albanian} \label{albanian synchr}
The Albanian branch of Indoeuropean is represented with the two languages Albanian and Arvanitika.

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization + head-driven agreement in Albanian}
In both Albanian languages, adjectives normally follow the head noun and are marked with an article which links its host to the modified noun. Additionally, adjectives are equipped with agreement inflection suffixes co-referencing the \textsc{number}-, \textsc{gender}-, \textsc{case}- and \textsc{species} values of the head noun. The language thus exhibits an attributive marking device which is a combination of a phonologically free article (historically an attributive nominalizer) and agreement suffixes.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Albanian} \citep[166–167]{himmelmann1997} \label{albanian ex}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	nj\"e	shok 	\textbf{i}	\textbf{mir\"e}\\
	one:\textsc{m}	friend:\textsc{indef:m} 	\textsc{attr:nom.sg.m}	good:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘one good friend’
\ex	
\gll	shok=u			\textbf{i}			\textbf{mir\"e}\\
	friend=\textsc{def:nom.sg.m} 	\textsc{attr:nom.sg.m} 	good:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘the good friend’
\ex
\gll	shok=un					\textbf{e}			\textbf{mir\"e}\\
	friend=\textsc{def:acc.sg.m} 	\textsc{attr:acc.sg.m} 	good:\textsc{acc.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘the good friend (\textsc{acc})’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the circum-positioned agreement marker also occurs with predicative adjectives. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Albanian} \citep{demiraj1998}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Predicative agreement of “article adjectives”
\gll	shok=u \"esht\"e \textbf{i} \textbf{bukur}\\
	friend-\textsc{def:nom.sg.m} be\textsc{.3sg.prs} \textsc{attr:nom.sg.m} pretty:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘the friend is pretty’
\ex Predicative agreement of “simple” adjectives
\gll	shok=u \"esht\"e \textbf{besnik}\\
	friend-\textsc{def:nom.sg.m} be\textsc{.3sg.prs} true:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘the friend is faithful’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Since adjectives in attributive and predicative position are both equipped with the circumfixed agreement marker the language seems to belong simply to the head-driven agreement type. However, true predicative adjectives are not found in Albanian. Instead, headless attributive adjectives are used in predicative position. This is evidenced by case agreement of predicates.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Albanian} \citep{demiraj1998}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	Agimi {u kthye} \textbf{i} \textbf{dëshpëruar}\\
	Agimi(\textsc{nom.sg.m}) returned \textsc{attr:nom.sg.m} sorrowful:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘Agim returned sorrowfully’
\ex
\gll	Agimi(\textsc{acc.sg.m}) e pashtë \textbf{të} \textbf{dëshpëruar}\\
	Agimi I saw \textsc{attr:acc.sg.m} sorrowful:\textsc{acc.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘I saw Agimi sorrowful’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
On the other hand, the similar agreement behavior of attributive and predicative adjectives seems to indicate the absence of specific attributive morpho-syntactic marking. However, the attributive article is polyfunctional and can also link other adnominal attributes in addition to adjectives to the modified noun. The analysis of adjective attribution marking in Albanian as belonging to the attributive nominalization type (in combination with head-driven agreement) thus seems justified.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Albanian} \citep{demiraj1998}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	roman-i 			\textbf{i} 			tretë\\
	novel-\textsc{def:nom.sg.m} \textsc{attr:nom.sg.m} third\\
\glt	‘the third novel’
\ex	
\gll	libr-i 	\textbf{i}  nxënës-it\\
	book(\textsc{m})-\textsc{def:nom.sg.m} \textsc{attr:nom.sg.m} pupil-\textsc{def:gen/dat.sg}\\
\glt	‘the pupil's book’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement marking in Albanian}
Note, however, that the occurrence of the attributive article is restricted to a lexically defined subclass of adjectives in Albanian: Only the so-called “article adjectives” are regularly marked with the article. Other adjectives are marked with with head-driven agreement affixes alone.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Albanian} (\citealt[167]{himmelmann1997})
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	shok=u					\textbf{besnik}\\
	friend-\textsc{def:nom.sg.m} 	true:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘the faithful friend’
\ex
\gll 	nj\"e			shok					\textbf{besnik}\\
	one:\textsc{m}	friend:\textsc{indef:m} 	true:\textsc{nom.sg.m}\\
\glt	‘one faithful friend’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization + head-driven agreement marking in Arvanitika}
Adjective attribution marking in Arvanitika is very similar to Albanian. One adjective class shows head-driven agreement marking by means of suffixes. The second adjective class is cognate with the so-called “article adjectives” in Albanian and exhibits attributive nominalization. 
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Arvanitika} (\citealt[303]{sasse1991})
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	ɲə́ 			djáʎə 			\textbf{i-mírə}\\
	one:\textsc{m} 	boy:\textsc{indef.m} 	\textsc{m}-good:\textsc{m}\\
\glt	‘one good boy’
\ex
\gll				djáʎi 				\textbf{i-mírə}\\
				boy:\textsc{def.m} 	\textsc{m}-good:\textsc{m}\\
\glt	‘the good boy’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Unlike in Albanian, however, the preposed attributive nominalizer in Arvanitika is a phonologically bound formative. This is evidenced by its phonological behavior in adjective compounds, where the marker sticks to the adjective stem.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Arvanitika} (\citealt[304]{sasse1991}) \label{alb noclitic}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{miso-i-}ngrə́nə /\- \textbf{miso-tə-}ngrə́nə\\
	half-\textsc{m}-mounted:\textsc{m} { } half-\textsc{acc.m}-mounted:\textsc{m}\\
\glt	‘half-mounted’
\ex	*i-miso-ngrə́nə /\- *tə-miso-ngrə́nə
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Example (\ref{alb noclitic}) shows that the compound degree word {\it miso-} does not move between the adjective stem and the attributive nominalizer. Consequently, the nominalizer can be characterized as a (phonologically bound but morpho-syntactically free) clitic which always attaches on a fixed position, i.e.~on the left of the adjective stem.\footnote{Note, however, that the agreement categories \textsc{case/\-number/\-gender} are merged into several differentiated morphemes in the suffixed part of the circumfix \cite[124–128]{sasse1991}.}

\subsection{Armenian}
Armenian is a branch consisting only of two closely related varieties, of which only the East-Armenian standard language is considered here.

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in East-Armenian} 
In the unmarked construction, attributive adjectives are unmarked and precede the modified noun.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Modern E-Armenian} \citep{ajello1998}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{bari} gorc\\
	good:\textsc{nom.sg} work(\textsc{nom.sg})\\
\glt	‘good work’
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{bari} gorc-s\\
	good work-\textsc{acc.pl}\\
\glt	‘good work (\textsc{acc.pl})’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Armenian}
A few monosyllabic adjectives show head-driven agreement marking in Armenian. 

In theory, however, all adjectives in an emphatic construction can occur in a noun phrase with reversed word order. In “emphatic position” \cite[224]{ajello1998}, attributive adjectives show agreement in case and number as a rule.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Modern Armenian (Eastern)} \cite[224]{ajello1998}
\gll	bazum gorc-s \textbf{bari-s}\\
	much work-\textsc{acc.pl} good-\textsc{acc.pl}\\
\glt	‘much GOOD work (acc)’
\end{exe}

\subsection{Indo-Iranian}
Indo-Iranian (aka Aryan) is a major branch inside Indoeuropean. But only a few Indo-Iranian languages belonging to the Iranian and Indo-Aryan subbranches are spoken in northern Eurasia and thus considered here. Most other Indo-Iranian languages are spoken in the Middle East and in South-Asia and hence outside the investigated geographic area. 

\subsubsection{Indo-Aryan}
Indo-Aryan (aka Indic) is a large subbranch of Indo-Iranian, most member languages of which are spoken on the Indic subcontinent. Outlier languages, spoken in northern Eurasia include Parya, a language which was recently discovered in Tajikistan in Central Asia \cite[22]{masica1991} and the group of Romany languages. 

The default type of adjective attribution marking in Indo-Aryan languages is head-driven agreement in noun phrases with head-final word order \cite[369]{masica1991}.

\paragraph{Romany}

Several varieties of Romany are spoken all over Europe. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. Rather than being one single language, Romany is thus a group of languages which comprise at least the four subbranches Vlax-Romany, Balkan Romany, Central Romany and Northern Romany with several single varieties in each of them \citep[2–3]{halwachs-etal2002}.

The prototypical adjective attribution marking device in Romany is head-driven agreement. Agreement features are \textsc{gender} and \textsc{number}, and in most varieties also \textsc{case}. The unmarked word order in all varieties of Romany is adjective-noun %CITE.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Burgenland-Romany}

In the Burgenland variety of Romany adjectives normally show agreement in gender, number and also in case with the head noun. Case agreement, however, can be characterized as defective since all attributive adjectives preceding oblique cases have one similar oblique form.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Romany (Burgenland)} \cite[22–23]{halwachs-etal2002}
\begin{xlist} 
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{bar-o} phral\\
	big-\textsc{nom:m.sg} brother(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘big brother’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{bar-i} phen\\
	big-\textsc{nom:f.sg} sister(\textsc{f})\\
\glt	‘big sister’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in in Burgenland-Romany}
A minor lexically defined subclass of adjectives in Burgenland-Romany is indeclinable and juxtaposed to the head noun.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Romany (Burgenland)} \citep[22–23]{halwachs-etal2002}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{schukar} phral\\
	beautiful brother(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘beautiful brother’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{schukar} phen\\
	beautiful sister(\textsc{f})\\
\glt	‘beautiful sister’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Vlax-Romany}
\citet{hancock1995} describes the use of a “repeated definite article” in contrastive-focus constructions in Vlax-Romany. 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Vlax-Romany} \citep[30]{hancock1995}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Head-driven agreement (unmarked construction)
\gll	o \textbf{baro} raklo\\
	\textsc{def}	big	boy\\
\glt ‘the big boy’
\ex Attributive nominalization (emphatic construction)
\gll	o raklo \textbf{o} \textbf{baro}\\
	\textsc{def}	{boy}	\textsc{attr} big\\
\glt	‘the BIG boy’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Iranian}\label{iranian synchr}
The second subbranch of Indo-Iranian is formed by Iranian languages, only few of which are spoken in northern Eurasia.\\

\noindent A well-known characteristic of noun phrase structure in Iranian languages is the occurrence of the Ezafe construct marking which licenses the attribution of adjectives (and other syntactic classes of modifiers). The Iranian languages surveyed in the present investigation, however, exhibit some diversity in this respect. Attributive construct state marking occurs regularly only in the western Iranian languages Kurmanji (aka Kirmancî) and Tajik.

\paragraph{Attributive construct state marking in Tajik} Tajik follows the Iranian prototype and exhibits a head-marking construct state marking suffix.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Tajik} \citep{rastorgueva1963}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	duxtar\textbf{-i} \textbf{xušrūj}\\
	girl-\textsc{attr} beautiful\\
\glt	‘a pretty girl’
\ex
\gll	duxtar-on\textbf{-i} \textbf{xušrūj}\\
	girl-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{attr} beautiful\\
\glt	‘pretty girls’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Anti-construct in Northern Talysh} \label{talysh synchr}
The constituent order in noun phrases in Northern Talysh is adjective-noun. The language is exceptional a\-mong the Iranian (and Indoeuropean) languages considered here in exhibiting dependent marking anti-construct state instead of head-marking construct state as the default type of adjective attribution marking.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Talysh (Northern)} \cite[27]{schulze2000}%CHECK PAGES
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	\textbf{āğəlmānd-a} odam-on\\
	clever-\textsc{attr} man-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘clever people’
\ex
\gll	\textbf{yol-a} di\\
	big-\textsc{attr} tree\\
\glt	‘(a) big tree’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Ossetic}
Ossetic is another exceptional language among Iranian because the language exhibits juxtaposition as the default type of adjective attribution marking.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Ossetic} \cite[12]{abaev1964} \label{ossetic attrcomp}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Simple noun
\gll	færǽt / fǽræt\\
	ax { } ax\textbackslash\textsc{def}\\
\glt	‘axe’ / ‘the axe’
\ex	Noun phrase with adjectival modifier
\gll	\textbf{cyrg'-}fǽræt / \textbf{cýrg'-}færæt\\
	sharp-axe { } sharp-ax\textbackslash\textsc{def}\\
\glt	‘sharp axe’ / ‘the sharp axe’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Stress patterns provide evidence for the analysis of Ossetic noun phrase structure as phonological compounds. According to \citet[10]{abaev1964}, “syntactically connected word groups” (such as noun phrases) are marked by single stress. Note that stress, moving from the second to the first syllable, marks definiteness in Ossetic \citep[12]{abaev1964}. There is, however, no evidence that the compounded adjectives are syntactically incorporated.

Note that attributive construct state marking which is cognate with the Ezafe in other Iranian languages, occurs in Ossetic as well but its use is restricted to certain emphatic constructions \cite[467]{thodarson1989}.

\subsection{Baltic} \label{baltic synchr}
\subsubsection{East-Baltic}
The Baltic languages form a small branch among Indoeuropean and are represented in the present survey only by the two languages Lithuanian and Latvian. Both belong to the eastern subbranch of Baltic. All languages from the western branch of Baltic are extinct.\\

\noindent Two types of adjective attribution marking occur in modern Baltic languages: head-driven agreement and anti-construct state agreement. In the descriptive literature on Baltic languages, however, these two noun phrase types are normally not ascribed to syntax but as different agreement declension types determined by the definite or indefinite semantics of the noun phrase.

In Part \ref{part typ} (Section \ref{anti-constr agr}) it has already been thoroughly argued in favor of a syntactic differentiation of these two agreement marking devices in Baltic (as well as in different Sla\-vic) languages. Consequently and for the sake of completeness, examples of head-driven agreement marking (the so-called indefinite declension) and anti-construct state agreement marking (the so-called definite declension) in Latvian and Lithuanian will be repeated in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement marking in Latvian and Lithuanian} 
Adjectives modifying indefinite nouns show head-driven agreement in Latvian and Lithuanian.

\begin{exe}
\ex 
\begin{xlist}
\ex	\textsc{Latvian} (\citealt[115]{dahl2007})
\gll 	\textbf{liel-a} māja\\
	big-\textsc{f.nom.sg} house(\textsc{f})\\
\glt	‘a large house’
\ex \textsc{Lithuanian} (\citealt[13]{bechert1993})
\gll 	\textbf{gēr-as}			profèsorius\\
	good-\textsc{nom.sg.m} professor(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘a good professor’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking in Latvian and Lithuanian}
Adjectives modifying definite nouns show anti-construct state agreement marking in Latvian and Lithuanian.
\begin{exe}
\ex 
\begin{xlist}	
\ex	\textsc{Latvian} (\citealt[115]{dahl2007})
\gll 	\textbf{liel-ā} māja\\

\glt	‘the large house’
\ex \textsc{Lithuanian} (\citealt[13]{bechert1993})
\gll 	\textbf{gēr-àsis}		profèsorius\\
	good-\textsc{attr:nom.sg.m}	professor(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘the good professor’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Celtic}
The modern Celtic languages belong to two main branches: Gaelic and Brittonic. By and large, all Celtic languages have preserved the proto-Celtic noun phrase structure, including head-driven agreement marking on attributive adjectives and noun-adjective constituent order.

\subsubsection{Gaelic}
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement marking in Scots Gaelic} 
In Scots Gaelic (aka Scottish Gaelic) adjectives (as well as other modifiers) show agreement in \textsc{gender, number}, and {\sc case}.
\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Scots Gaelic} \cite[201]{macauley1992}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	an cù \textbf{dubh}\\
	\textsc{def:m} dog(\textsc{m}) black\textbackslash\textsc{m}\\
\glt	‘the black dog’
\ex
\gll	a' chaora \textbf{dhubh}\\
	\textsc{def:f} sheep(\textsc{f}) black\textbackslash\textsc{f}\\
\glt	‘the black sheep’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Similar agreement patterns as in Scots Gaelic, with non-linear marking by means of word-initial permutation, are found in Irish \cite[73, 97]{odochartaigh1992}. In the third Gaelic language Manx, however, most adjectives are used in an invariable form. Only a certain subclass of monosyllabic adjectives have preserved number agreement in Manx \cite[127]{thomsen1992}.

\subsubsection{Brittonic}
The tendency towards a loss of agreement inflection of adjectives is also noticeable in the languages of the Brittonic branch of Celtic. Adjective inflection seems to be most intact in Welsh with preserved gender and number agreement \cite[298–299]{thomas1992a}. Breton and Cornish exhibit only agreement in gender (\citealt[405]{ternes1992}; \citealt[355]{thomas1992b}).

\subsection{Germanic}
The modern Germanic languages belong to two branches: North- and West-Germanic. The third Germanic subbranch, East-Germanic, is extinct and not considered here.\\

\noindent The constituent order of adjective and noun is relatively strictly head-final in all modern Germanic languages.\footnote{The exclusive adjective-initial word order in modern Germanic languages is clearly innovative. In documents of all Old Germanic languages the order of adjective and noun was still relatively free \citep[cf.][]{heinrichs1954}.}  Most Germanic languages have also preserved the inherited agreement marking on attributive adjectives. But several secondary attributive marking devices have evolved at different stages in the history of Germanic.\\

\noindent The following noun phrase types occur inside the Germanic branch of Indoeuropean:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Anti-construct state agreement}
\item{Anti-construct state agreement + head-driven agreement}
\item{Attributive article + head-driven agreement}
\item{Head-driven agreement}
\item{Incorporation.}
\end{itemize}
Whereas head-driven agreement and attributive nominalization are attested for the earliest stages of Germanic, adjective incorporation is a rather recent innovation (cf.~Section \ref{germanic diachr}).

\subsubsection{West-Germanic}\label{w-germanic synchr}
The most common type of adjective attribution marking in West-Germanic languages is head-driven agreement. In most languages of this group, this is the only existing type.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement in German}
Attributive adjectives in German show head-driven agreement according to the features \textsc{gender, number, case} and \textsc{species}. The complete agreement paradigm was illustrated in Part \ref{part typ} (Figure \ref{german agr} on Page \pageref{german agr}). Note, that the adjective agreement paradigm of German exhibits a high degree of syncretism due to merger of originally differentiated formatives. The whole paradigm distinguishes only the four suffixes \textit{-e, -em, -en, -er, -es}.
\begin{exe}
\ex Attributive adjectives in \textsc{German} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	ein \textbf{hoh-es} Haus\\
	\textsc{indef} high-\textsc{indef.n} house(\textsc{n})\\
\glt	‘a high house’
\ex	
\gll	das \textbf{hoh-e} Haus\\
	\textsc{def} high-\textsc{def.n} house(\textsc{n})\\
\glt	‘the high house’
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{hoh-e} Häus-er\\
	high-\textsc{pl} house-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘high houses’
\ex	
\gll	der \textbf{hoh-en} Häus-er\\
	\textsc{def:pl.gen} high-\textsc{def.pl.gen} house-\textsc{pl.gen}\\
\glt	‘of the high houses’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Attributive and predicative adjectives are morpho-syntactically differentiated in German (and the other West-Germanic languages, except English):  Whereas attributive adjectives show head-driven agreement, predicative adjectives are use in an invariable form. Given the definition of dependent marking attributive state which is applied here (see Chapter \ref{syntax-morphology-interface}), German thus exhibits anti-construct state agreement marking of attributive adjectives.
\begin{exe}
\ex Predicative adjectives in \textsc{German} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}

\paragraph{Attributive article + head-driven agreement in Yiddish} \label{yiddish synchr}
The default noun phrase structure in Yiddish is similar to the other West-Germanic languages. Head-driven agreement occurs as the default type of attribution marking of adjectives. In con\-trastive-focus construction, however, adjectives and other modifiers follow the modified noun in an attributive nominalization construction.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Yiddish (Eastern)} \cite[96]{jacobs-etal1994}

\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Incorporation in English}
English is the only West-Germanic language where head-driven agreement is missing completely. The original Germanic agreement marking type was lost in favor of juxtaposition. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{English} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll	a \textbf{pretty} girl\\
	\textsc{indef} pretty girl\\
\ex
\gll	the \textbf{pretty} girl\\
	\textsc{def} pretty girl\\
\ex 
\gll	\textbf{pretty} girl-s\\
	pretty girl-\textsc{pl}\\
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Attributive adjectives cannot, however, occur in headless noun phrases in English but are obligatorily marked with an article used as dummy head.
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	a / the \textbf{smart} \textbf{one}\\
	\textsc{indef} {} \textsc{def} smart \textsc{art}\\
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{smart} \textbf{one-s}\\
	smart \textsc{art}-\textsc{pl}\\
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The marker \textit{one} in English (originating from the homophone numeral ‘one’) is a prototypical instance of an article: it constitutes a phonologically unbound grammatical word which is the target of agreement. 

Given that attributive adjectives cannot occur other than syntactically bound to a head noun, the regular noun phrase type in English is best analyzed as incorporation. Note that the article is not an attribution marking device in the proper sense. Even though the marker projects a noun phrase by syntactic nominalization, this noun phrase does not modify a higher noun. The nominalization strategy can only be used in noun phrases with an empty lexical head.
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	{} a smart girl\\
	$[_{NP}$ \textsc{indef} $_{A}$smart $_{N}$girl $]$\\
\ex
\gll	{} a smart \textbf{one}\\
	$[_{NP}$ \textsc{indef} $_{A}$smart $_{HEAD}$ $]$\\
\ex
\gll	{*} {} {} a smart \textbf{one} {} girl\\
	{} $[_{NP}$  $[_{NP}$ \textsc{indef} $_{A}$smart $_{HEAD}$ $]$ $_{N}$girl $]$\\
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Because attributive adjectives in English are obligatorily bound to syntactic heads and because the nominalizer (dummy head) cannot occur with noun phrases modifying a higher head, English neither exhibits true juxtaposition nor attributive nominalization.

\subsubsection{North-Germanic} \label{n-germanic synchr}
With regard to existing attribution marking devices, the North-Germanic languages exhibit even higher diversity than West-Germanic. This is especially true if major sub-varieties are considered as well. Practically all types attested in West-Germanic occur here as well plus an additional type (adjective incorporation) which is otherwise scarcely attested in the languages of northern Eurasia.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement marking in North-Germanic} Even though head-driven agreement marking constitutes the prototypical adjective attribution marking device in North-Germanic, the adjective agreement paradigms across the different languages reflect the ongoing decline in differentiated categories.

In {\bf Icelandic}, adjectives inflect for the agreement features \textsc{gender}, \textsc{number}, \textsc{case} and \textsc{species}. The adjective agreement paradigm of Modern Icelandic (Table \ref{icelandic agr} in Section \ref{head-driven agreement}) is thus relatively similar to Old Icelandic even though the different case endings are already merged in the definite paradigm.

In {\bf Danish},\label{danish synchr} there is no agreement feature \textsc{case}, while \textsc{gender} is marked on the attributive adjective only in indefinite noun phrases. In definite noun phrases, the attributive adjective is marked with an invariable definite agreement suffix (Table \ref{danish agr paradigm}). 

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{tabular}[h]{l|c c c}

\caption[Adjective paradigm for \textsc{Danish}]{Agreement paradigm for the adjective ‘yellow’ in \textsc{Danish} (own knowledge)}\label{danish agr paradigm}
\end{footnotesize}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The Danish dialect {\bf West-Jutlandic}, finally, is most innovative with regard to the decline of agreement features because it has almost completely lost its agreement features and thus resembles English (Table \ref{jutl agr paradigm}).

\paragraph{Anti-construct state + head-driven agreement marking in Swedish}\label{swedish synchr}
Swe\-dish, Norwegian,\footnote{The two Norwegian standard languages Dano- and New Norwegian do not differ in their marking of adjective attribution and they will simply be referred to as Norwegian} and Faroese exhibit two adjective attribution marking morphemes simultaneously: an inflectional suffix expressing the agreement features \textsc{gender}, \textsc{number} and \textsc{species} (but the indefinite utrum gender form of the adjective is always unmarked) plus an article (which again is not found in the indefinite plural form).

\begin{table}

\end{footnotesize}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In the (North-)Germanic and typological linguistic tradition, the definite noun phrases with adjectives have most often been characterized as “double definite” (cf.~\citealt{borjars1994}; \citealt{julien2003}; \citealt[354–355]{plank2003}). This makes sense from a historical perspective because the articles (Swedish \textit{den, det, de}) are cognate with the Old Germanic demonstratives which developed into definite markers (cf.~German \textit{der, die, das} or English \textit{the}). Synchronically, however, the articles in the North-Germanic languages with so-called double definiteness (Swedish, both Norwegian languages, Faroese) are not definiteness markers. Unlike in West-Germanic, definiteness is exclusively expressed by an inflectional suffix (Swedish \textit{-(e)n} \textsc{utr}, \textit{-(e)t} \textsc{n}, \textit{-n} \textsc{pl}.)

Unlike in West-Germanic languages, where the definite markers are noun phrase markers always attach at the left edge of the phrase, the presence or absence of the cognate articles \textit{den} \textsc{utr}, \textit{det} \textsc{n}, \textit{de(m)} \textsc{pl} in Swedish is determined by the availability of an adjective and not the referential status of the noun phrase. 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Swedish} (own knowledge) \label{swedish np}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	(*det) hus\textbf{-et}\\
	{} house-\textsc{def:n}\\
\glt	‘the house’
\ex	
\gll	*(\textbf{det}) \textbf{hög-a} hus-et\\
	\textsc{attr:def.n} high-\textsc{def.n} house-\textsc{def.n}\\
\glt	‘the high house’
\ex	\label{art0}
\gll	*(\textbf{det}) \textbf{hög-a}\\
	\textsc{attr:def.n} high-\textsc{def.n}\\
\glt	‘the high one’ (about a house)
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Example (\ref{swedish np}) shows how the article can neither attach to a noun nor can an adjectival modifier in a definite noun phrase occur without being marked by the article.\footnote{The expression \textit{det hus} is grammatical only with the homophone demonstrative \textit{det}, similarly (but restricted to certain regiolects) \textit{det hus-et}. Even the expressions \textit{höga hus-et} is possible for some expression similar to English \textit{White house}. Note also that possessive pronouns replace the article: \textit{min hög-a hus} [\textsc{poss:1sg} high-\textsc{def.n} house(\textsc{n}] 'my high house’.} Since the definite value of the feature \textsc{species} is always marked by the respective definite inflectional noun suffixes %in headless noun phrases, the definite inflection is absent 
 and since the article only attaches to adjectives, the latter cannot be analyzed as anything but a morpho-syntactic device, i.e.~as an adjective attribution marker.

In definite noun phrases, Swedish thus exhibits a circumfixed adjective attribution marking device combined by head-driven agreement inflection plus the article. It is self-evident that the article developed from an attributive nominalizer. Its use with headless adjectives, as in (\ref{art0}) resembles attributive nominalization. There is, however, no evidence that the adjective marked by the article is part of a complex constituent (i.e.~a headless noun phrase) modifying a noun. According to the definition of attributive nominalization presented in Section \ref{attr nmlz} of Part \ref{part typ}, the article in Swedish is thus not a syntactic nominalizer. Its function is the licensing of the attributive state of the adjective along with marking of head-driven agreement. Since head-driven agreement is additionally marked by inflectional suffixes, the Swedish noun phrase exhibits circum-positioned – phonologically free and phonologically bound – agreement marking.

Note that the circum-positioned agreement marker only occurs with attributive adjectives. Predicative adjectives, on the other hand, exhibit “pure” gender and number agreement (\ref{swed pred}). The analysis of adjective attribution marking in Swedish as belonging to anti-construct state agreement marking is thus justified.
\begin{exe}
\ex Predicative adjectives in \textsc{Swedish} (own knowledge)\label{swed pred}

\paragraph{Adjective incorporation in Västerbotten-Swedish} \label{bondska synchr}
The dialect spoken in the Västerbotten province in northern Sweden exhibits adjective incorporation as a regular type of adjective attribution marking
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Västerbotten-Swedish} \citep[91–92]{holmberg-etal2003}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll 	\textbf{grann-}kweinn-a\\

\ex
\gll	en \textbf{grann-}kweinn\\
	\textsc{indef} pretty-woman\\
\glt	‘a pretty woman’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Adjective incorporation also occurs in several other northern North-Germanic dialects of Sweden, Finland and Norway. Whereas adjective incorporation is the default type in Väster\-botten-Swedish,\footnote{In indefinite noun phrases, however, adjective incorporation is often restricted to monosyllabic adjective stems: \textit{en \textbf{grann-}kweinn} but *\textit{en \textbf{vacker-}kweinn} ‘a \textbf{pretty} woman’. Furthermore, a certain semantic relation between noun and adjective seem to be obligatory: (incorporation) \textit{n \textbf{ny-}bil} ‘a \textbf{new} car (straight from the factory)’, \textit{n \textbf{ny} bil} ‘a \textbf{new} car (new for me)’, (incorporation) *\textit{n \textbf{ny-}hunn} ‘a \textbf{new} dog’, \textit{n \textbf{ny} hunn} ‘a \textbf{new} dog (new for me)’ \cite[91–92]{holmberg-etal2003}.} its occurrence is restricted to definite noun phrases in most other dialects where this type it attested.

Attributive adjectives cannot occur in indefinite headless noun phrases in Västerbotten-Swedish but are obligatorily bound to an article used as dummy head.

\subsection{Hellenic}\label{greek synchr}
The Hellenic branch of Indoeuropean is represented by a single language: Modern Greek. 

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement and attributive nominalization + head-driven agreement in Greek}
Attributive adjectives in Greek show agreement in \textsc{gender, number} and \textsc{case}.\footnote{A minor class of loan adjectives in Greek belong to a different noun phrase type (i.e.~juxtaposition) because they do not inflect at all \cite{ruge1986}.}

The unmarked constituent order in Greek is adjective-noun, as in example (\ref{greek afocus}). The reverse constituent order (noun-adjective), however, is commonly used as well and marks contrastive focus on the attribute, as in example (\ref{greek afocus}).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{(Modern) Greek} \citep{ruge1986}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Head-driven agreement \label{greek agr}
\gll	to			\textbf{kokkino} 	aytokinēto\\
	\textsc{def:m}	red:\textsc{m}	car(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘the red car’
\ex	Attributive nominalization \label{greek attr}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Contrastive focus on the attribute \label{greek afocus}
\gll	to 			aytokinēto		\textbf{to}				\textbf{kokkino}\\
	\textsc{def:m}	car(\textsc{m})	\textsc{attr:m}	red:\textsc{m}\\
\glt	‘the RED car (not the blue one)’
\ex	Contrastive focus on the noun \label{greek nfocus}
\gll	\textbf{to}				\textbf{kokkino}		to		aytokinēto\\
	\textsc{attr:m}	red:\textsc{m}	\textsc{def:m}	car(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘the red CAR (not the buss)’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the noun can move to the contrastive-focus position as well, as in example (\ref{greek nfocus}).

Example (\ref{greek attr}) illustrates the use of the article \textit{to} in two different syntactic functions: Whereas \textit{to} \textsc{def} is a determiner marking the noun phrase as definite, \textit{to} \textsc{attr} is an attributive marker (i.e.~a true article) attaching to the adjective noun phrase internally. Attribution of the (contrastive-focused) adjective in (\ref{greek afocus}) is marked by means of attributive nominalization. The article marks the adjective as phrasal constituent, i.e.~as a syntactic complement to the noun.

\subsection{Romance}
All Romance (aka Italic) languages exhibit head-driven agreement marking as the main and default adjective attribution marking device. The prototypical agreement features characteristic of most modern Romance languages are \textsc{number} and \textsc{gender}. A third agreement feature, \textsc{case}, was present in earlier stages of Romance but has disappeared in the modern languages.

Three noun phrase types have existed in the Romance branch of IE from its earliest stages:\footnote{A minor class of adjectives belong to a different noun phrase type (i.e.~juxtaposition) because they do not inflect at all.}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Head-driven agreement}
	\subitem —noun-adjective
	\subitem —adjective-noun
\item{Attributive nominalization.}
\end{itemize}
The unmarked and prototypical noun phrase type in Romance is head-driven agreement with the adjective following the noun. Beside the basic head-initial word order, most Romance languages exhibit a small subgroup of very common adjectives, such as ‘good–bad, young–old, small–large’, which normally precede the head noun (\citealt[146–147]{posner1996}, cf.~also \citealt[340]{silvestri1998}). However, most other adjectives can also precede the noun in the modern Romance languages. This reversed word order is regularly determined by semantics-pragmatics in Rumanian and is used to give these adjectives a certain emphasis or contrastive focus, as in the following examples from Rumanian (\ref{rumanian wo}) and Italian (\ref{italian wo}).
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist} 
\ex	\textsc{Rumanian} \citep{beyer-etal1987} \label{rumanian wo} 
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	băiat=ul \textbf{bun}\\
	boy=\textsc{def} good\\
\glt	‘the good boy’
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{bun}=ul băiat\\
	good=\textsc{def} boy\\
\glt	‘the GOOD (i.e.~different) boy’ 
\end{xlist}

\ex \textsc{Italian} \cite[146]{posner1996} \label{italian wo}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	un vestito \textbf{nuovo}\\
	\textsc{indef} dress new\\
\glt	‘a (brand-)new dress’
\ex	
\gll	un \textbf{nuovo} vestito\\
	\textsc{indef} new dress\\
\glt	‘a new (i.e.~different) dress’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the definite marker in Rumanian is not connected with attribution marking on adjectives. Even though the marker can occur on the attributive adjective which precedes the noun in contrastive use (\ref{rumanian wo}), definiteness is a purely morpho-semantic feature in Rumanian and is not assigned by syntax (see also Section \ref{syntax-morphology-interface} in Part \ref{part-theory}).

The common distinction between an ‘emphatic’ adjective preceding a noun and a ‘descriptive’ adjective following a noun can be attested in Classical Latin \cite[146]{posner1996} but probably goes back to the earliest stages of Romance.

\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Italian} 
In Italian, the agreement features \textsc{gender} and \textsc{number} are marked on adjectives and on other modifiers within the noun phrase.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Italian} (own knowledge)
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll	la casa \textbf{alt-a}\\
	\textsc{def:f} house(\textsc{f}) high-\textsc{f}\\

\ex
\gll	le cas-e \textbf{alt-e}\\
	\textsc{def:pl} house-\textsc{pl} high-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘the high houses’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization in Rumanian}\label{rumanian synchr}
Beside the default type of head-driven agreement (with either noun-adjective or adjective-noun word order), Standard Rumanian (aka Daco-Rumanian) exhibits attributive nominalization as a differentiated third type of adjective attribution marking. The agreement paradigm of the attributive nominalizer (traditionally labelled “adjective article” in the grammatical descriptions of Rumanian) is shown in Table \ref{rumanian art}.
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{tabular}[ht]{r | c c c}

\hline
		&\textsc{f}						&\textsc{n}		&\textsc{m}\\

\end{footnotesize}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The use of the non-obligatory attributive marker emphasizes the adjective following a noun (\citealt[94]{beyer-etal1987}, \citealt[148]{posner1996}). But it is also regularly used to mark definite headless noun phrases, as in the following example.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Rumanian} \citep[94]{beyer-etal1987} %check glossing
\gll Punct-e=le \textbf{cele} \textbf{negr-e} se disting mai bine decît \textbf{cele} \textbf{cenuşi-i}.\\
dot-\textsc{pl}=\textsc{def.m.pl} \textsc{att:m.pl} black-\textsc{pl} are distinguishing \textsc{compar} better than \textsc{att:m.pl} grey-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt ‘The black dots are more distinguishable than the grey ones.’
\end{exe}
The content of this marker, besides licensing of the attributive relation, is not clearly defined in descriptions of Rumanian. The article seems to regularly mark definite headless adjectives and superlative adjectives. \citet[141]{kramsky1972} compares the function of the article with that of the definite marker and describes the function of the attributive article in Rumanian as a “deictic reactualizer” because it has a referential function but can co-occur with the definite marker (\ref{rum def comp}). Note, however, that the definite marker is absent in a noun phrase with reversed word order marking contrastive focus (\ref{rum def sup}).
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Rumanian} \citep[93–94]{beyer-etal1987}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	\label{rum def comp}%check glossing

	\textsc{att:m.sg} \textsc{super} great poet(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘the GREATEST poet’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Sla\-vic} \label{slavic synchr}
Sla\-vic (aka Slavonic) forms a branch inside the Indoeuropean family. All Sla\-vic languages are spoken in Europe.\\

\noindent The prototypical type of adjective attribution marking is head-driven agreement. The prototypical agreement features characteristic of Sla\-vic languages are \textsc{number}, \textsc{gender} and \textsc{case}. In the South-Sla\-vic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, however, case inflection of nouns and adjectives has been lost.

Beside head-driven agreement, anti-construct state agreement arose in Sla\-vic languages as a secondary type of adjective attribution marking. The opposition of head-driven and anti-construct state agreement can be traced back to all Old Sla\-vic languages and already existed in the oldest Sla\-vic manuscripts, the best documented of which are from Old Bulgarian (aka Old Church Slavonic). To a certain extent, this state of development is still reflected in South-Sla\-vic. In most other modern Sla\-vic languages, however the opposition between the two types was lost by abolishing one or the other type.

Basically, the modern Sla\-vic languages belong to three types and exhibit the following three attribution marking devices:
\begin{itemize}
\item{exclusively head-driven agreement}
\item{exclusively anti-construct state agreement}
\item{simultaneously head-driven agreement and anti-construct state agreement}
\item{attributive nominalization.}
\end{itemize}
Word order in Sla\-vic is basically adjective-noun. The reversed word order is often possible but restricted to emphasized constructions or poetic language. 

\subsubsection{West-Sla\-vic}
All West-Sla\-vic languages exhibit head-driven agreement as the exclusive type of adjective attribution marking.
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement marking in Lower Sorbian}
Lower Sorbian exemplifies a Sla\-vic language with head-driven agreement as the exclusive type of adjective attribution marking. Attributive adjectives in Lower Sorbian show agreement in gender, number and case. 

\begin{exe}

\begin{xlist}

\glt	‘good people’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{East-Sla\-vic}
All three East-Sla\-vic languages Belorussian, Russian and Ukrainian exhibit anti-construct state agreement marking. There is, however, a tendency to merge to attributive (“long”) and predicative (“short”) adjective agreement declension classes yielding “pure” head-driven agreement as in West-Sla\-vic.

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking in Russian} \label{russian synchr}
In Russian, attributive as well as predicative adjectives show agreement in \textsc{gender} and \textsc{number}. Attributive adjectives agree additionally in \textsc{case}. The agreement suffixes of the attributive and predicative paradigms, however, have different forms.

The agreement suffixes of attributive and predicative adjectives clearly belong to different paradigms (cf.~Table \ref{Russian adj agr paradigm}). The so-called long agreement suffixes (\ref{ru attr}) mark the values of the morphological agreement features. Simultaneously, they license the (morpho-syntactic) attributive relation inside the noun phrase (cf.~also the discussion in Section \ref{anti-constr agr}).

\subsubsection{South-Sla\-vic} \label{s-slavic synchr}
All South-Sla\-vic languages exhibit head-driven agreement marking as the default type of adjective attribution marking. In Serbo-Croatian (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian) and Slovenian, anti-construct state agreement marking occurs as a secondary type. Even attributive nominalization is attested in Slovenian.
 
\paragraph{Head-driven agreement in Bulgarian}
Attributive adjectives in Bulgarian show agreement in the features \textsc{gender} and \textsc{number}.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Bulgarian} (own knowledge)\footnote{The stem allomorph with inserted -\textit{ă}- in \textsc{m.sg} is due to a phonological process. The stem allomorph with the extension -\textit{ij}- is morpho-phonological and triggered by the definite marker. Note that -\textit{ij}- is a reflex of the Old Bulgarian anti-construct state agreement marker.}

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement in Serbo-Croatian} \label{serbian synchr}
Serbian (just as the other varieties of Serbo-Croatian) exemplifies a Sla\-vic language which exhibits both head-driven agreement and anti-construct state agreement in different functions. Head-driven agreement constitutes the basic type of adjective attribution marking in Serbian. Most adjectives, however, have “double forms” \cite[179–180]{kramsky1972}. Consider the following example.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textbf{Serbian} \citep[59]{zlatic1997}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 	Indefinite noun phrase (“pure” head-driven agreement)
\gll	\textbf{dobar}, \textbf{veseo} čovek\\
	good:\textsc{m} cheerful:\textsc{m} person(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘a good, cheerful person’
\ex	Definite noun phrase (anti-construct state agreement)
\gll	\textbf{dobr-i}, \textbf{vesel-i} čovek\\
	good-\textsc{attr:m} cheerful-\textsc{attr:m} man(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘the GOOD, CHEERFUL person’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Anti-construct state agreement marking (“long form agreement”) in Serbo-Croatian is sometimes described as a definite marker on the adjective (e.g.~by \citealt[18–19]{kordic1997}). However, the short-form adjective can also be used in a noun phrase marked as definite, for instance by a demonstrative pronoun as in (\ref{serbian short-def}). And the “long form” adjective can also be used in a noun phrase marked as definite, for instance by the indefinite article. 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textbf{Serbian} \citep{marusic-etal2007}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Definite noun phrase with “pure” head-driven agreement \label{serbian short-def} 
\gll	ovaj \textbf{dobar}, \textbf{veseo} \v{c}ovek\\
	\textsc{dem:m} good:\textsc{m} cheerful:\textsc{m} person(\textsc{m})\\
\glt	‘this good, cheerful man’
\ex 	Indefinite noun phrase with anti-construct state agreement \label{serb indef}
\gll	Treba mi \textbf{jedan} \textbf{crven-i} kaput.\\
	need.\textsc{3sg} \textsc{1sg.dat} \textsc{indef:m} red-\textsc{attr:m} coat(\textsc{m})\\
\glt (in a store with red coats on display) ‘I need a RED coat (=one of those red coats).’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The examples with “short form” adjectives in definite contexts and “long form” adjectives in indefinite contexts provides the best evidence against the analyses of the two different adjective agreement suffixes as markers of species of the head noun. 

Rather than as a definite marker, the long-form adjective agreement suffixes in Serbian are best analyzed as anti-construct state agreement markers used in special contrastive-focused constructions.\footnote{Note even that school grammars of Serbian sometimes explain the rules for the use of the two adjective declensions with the help of the the questions “what sort?” (requires the “short form”) and “which one?” (requires the “long form”) \cite[327]{browne1993}.}

\paragraph{Anti-construct state agreement marking in Slovenian} \label{slovenian synchr}
In theory, Slovenian (aka Slo\-vene) is identical to Serbo-Croatian in exhibiting head-driven agreement marking and anti-construct state agreement marking as two separate devices for adjective attribution.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Slovenian} \citep[410]{priestly1993} \label{slov longshort}
\begin{xlist}
\ex “Short form” adjective (head-driven agreement)
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll 	\textbf{nȍv} pə̏s\\
	new:\textsc{nom.m.sg} dog\textsc{(m)}\\
\glt	‘new dog’
\ex	
\gll	en \textbf{nȍv} pə̏s\\
	\textsc{indef:m.sg} new:\textsc{nom.m.sg} dog\textsc{(m)}\\
\glt	‘a new dog’
\end{xlist}
\ex	“Long form” adjective (anti-construct state agreement)
\begin{xlist}
\ex	
\gll	\textbf{nóvi} pə̏s\\
	new:\textsc{attr:nom.m.sg} dog\textsc{(m)}\\
\glt	‘NEW dog’
\ex
\gll	{ta} \textbf{nóvi} pə̏s\\
	{\textsc{attr}} new:\textsc{attr:nom.m.sg} dog\textsc{(m)}\\
\glt	 ‘the NEW dog’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
%According to its morphological type, the non-concatenative anti-construct state agreement marking device in Slovenian seems to be exceptional among northern Eurasian languages because it constitutes a tonal distinction between short high tone (\textit{nȍv}) and long low tone \textit{nóvi}. %\footnote{The historical explanation, however, is straightforward and looks much less exotic...} 
Note, however, that the use of morphologically differentiated adjectives for head-driven agreement versus anti-construct state agreement in Slovenian is very restricted and is found more or less only with masculine adjectives in nominative singular \citep[410–411]{priestly1993}.

Similar to Serbo-Croatian, anti-construct state agreement marking in Slovenian is sometimes described as a definite marker on the adjective (e.g.~by \citealt[411]{priestly1993}). Semantic definiteness in Slovenian, however, is not obligatorily marked (cf.~example \ref{slov longshort}). Furthermore, the analysis of the anti-construct state agreement as a definite marker can be rejected completely because examples are found in which this marker also occurs in overtly marked indefinite noun phrases.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Slovenian} \citep{marusic-etal2007}
\gll 	rabi mi \textbf{en} \textbf{rde\v{c}i} pla\v{s}\v{c}\\
	need.\textsc{3sg} \textsc{1sg.dat} \textsc{indef:m} red:\textsc{attr:m} coat(\textsc{m})\\
\glt (in a store with red coats on display) ‘I need a RED coat (=one of those red coats).’ \footnote{Cf.~the similar construction with concatenative anti-construct state agreement marking in Serbian in example \ref{serb indef}.}
\end{exe}
Anti-construct agreement marking are thus analyzed as attribution marking device with the additional content of contrastive-focus rather than as a detached definite marker.

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization + head-driven agreement in Slovenian}
Besides head-driven agreement and anti-construct state agreement, adjectives in (colloquial) Slovenian can also be marked by means of an attributive article.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Slovenian} \citep{marusic-etal2007} \label{slovenian art}
\begin{xlist}
\ex Indefinite noun phrase
\gll	Lihkar je mim prdirkal en \textbf{ta} \textbf{hiter} avto.\\
	just\_now \textsc{aux} by speeded \textsc{indef:n} \textsc{attr} fast:n car(\textsc{n})\\
\glt	‘Some FAST car has just sped by (=one of the fast type of cars has just sped by).’ 
\ex Definite noun phrase \label{slovenian def}
\gll 	ta \textbf{ta} \textbf{zelen} \textbf{ta} \textbf{debel} svin\v{c}nik\\
	\textsc{dem} \textsc{attr} green\textsc{:m} \textsc{attr} thick\textsc{:m} pencil\\
\glt 	‘this GREEN, THICK pencil’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The attributive article \textit{ta} in Slovenian is homophone with the demonstrative determiner (from which it originates historically), but example (\ref{slovenian def}) with the double use of \textit{ta} on stacked adjectives and after the determiner clearly shows that these markers serve two different functions: Whereas \textit{ta} \textsc{dem} is a determiner marking the noun phrase for special local deictic species \textit{ta} \textsc{attr} is an attributive marker (i.e.~a true article) attaching noun phrase internally to the adjective. Attribution of the contrastive-focused adjective in (\ref{slovenian art}) is marked by means of attributive nominalization (in combination with head-driven agreement).

According to \cite{marusic-etal2007}, the article \textit{ta} gives the adjective a classifying reading and the construction \textit{ta}+A:\textsc{attr} can be compared to a “reduced relative clause”, hence a syntactic complement to the noun.

\section{Basque}
Basque is a language isolate spoken in the Basque country in northeastern Spain and in adjacent parts of France in Southwest-Europe. 

\paragraph{Juxtaposition in Basque}
Attributive adjectives are juxtaposed to the right of the noun they modify.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Basque} \citep[81]{saltarelli1988} \label{basque juxtap}
\gll	gona \textbf{gorri} \textbf{estu}-ak\\
	skirt red tight-\textsc{def.pl.abs}\\
\glt	‘the tight red skirts’
\end{exe}
Note that the features \textsc{definiteness, number}, and \textsc{case} in example (\ref{basque juxtap}) are not assigned to the adjective through agreement. The respective portmanteau suffixes marking the values of these morphological features always attach to right edge of the phrase in Basque. Consequently, they always attaches to the attributive adjective if one is present \cite[171]{hualde-etal2003}
