\chapter[The evolution of attribution marking]{The evolution of attribution marking in northern Eurasian languages}
Attribution marking devices were typologized in Part \ref{part typ} and their geographic distribution across the genealogical entities of northern Eurasia was presented in Part \ref{part synchr}. The present, diachronic part focuses on linguistic changes which led to the emergence of the attested synchronic diversity within the northern Eurasian area.

Not all attested changes are investigated in equal depth in each genealogical unit. Special focus lies on the grammaticalization of attributive markers from attributive nominalizers in the Saamic and Finnic branches of Uralic as well as in the Baltic, Sla\-vic and Germanic branches of Indoeuropean. Different types of adjective attribution marking have been grammaticalized from attributive nominalizers in different languages of the area and during different periods of time. Up to know, these diachronic patterns have not been systematically investigated from a cross-linguistic perspective.

The parallel evolution of attributive nominalizers and other adjective attribution marking devices is interesting not only from a general typological perspective. The linguistic interference zone between Uralic and Indoeuropean in northeastern Europe exhibits a relatively high degree of diversity from a synchronic point of view (cf.~Chapter \ref{areality} of Part \ref{part synchr}). Consequently, the question lays at hand whether or not the synchronically and diachronically attested developments have to be described in areal linguistics terms and provide further evidence for establishing a Northern European \textit{Sprachbund}.

\section[Attributive nominalizers]{The emergence of attributive nominalizers}
Attributive nominalization as a special subtype of dependent marking attributive state (cf.~Section \ref{attr nmlz}) is not synchronically attested as a default licensee of the attributive connection of adjectives in any language of northern Eurasia. However, in several languages of the area, attributive constructions with nominalizers constitute a special type of noun phrases characterized earlier as attributive apposition. A typical example is Udmurt (Uralic) where an adjectival attribute equipped with an article is marked for contrastive focus (cf.~Section \ref{udmurt synchr}).

The only Northern Eurasian languages exhibiting attributive nominalization as a default attribution marking device synchronically are from the Albanian branch (Indoeuropean). The marker, however,  is used only in a circumfixed construction together with the inherited head-driven agreement.

Attributive nominalizers are also documented in historical stages of several Indoeuropean branches, such as Baltic, Sla\-vic and Germanic. But even here, these markers are not the default devices. Instead, attributive articles compete with other attributive markers and are restricted to specially marked noun phrases. In several of these Indoeuropean languages, however, the articles have evolved into new default types of attribution marking. A prototypical example of attribution marking originating from an attributive article is anti-construct state agreement marking in Russian (cf.~Section \ref{russian synchr}). In other languages, the former attributive article is still traceable as secondary type of attribution marking, as in the modern Baltic languages. Here, the attributive article also evolved into an anti-construct state agreement marker but it is still restricted to a semantically defined subset of noun phrases (cf.~Section \ref{baltic synchr}). 

The synchrony and diachrony of attributive articles have also been dealt with in a cross-linguistic investigation of grammaticalized adnominal D(eictic) elements by \cite{himmelmann1997}. Himmelmann assumes that attributive articles (“linking articles” in his terminology) originally occurred in appositional nominal expressions. These “linking constructions” are characterized as complex noun phrases in which the attribute occurs as a syntactically independent nominal expression. The “linking article” (i.e.~{\it attributive article} in terms of the present typology) serves as a nominalizer and licenses the attribute as a syntagma of its own \cite[188]{himmelmann1997}.

The diachronic data from several Indoeuropean, Uralic and Turkic languages presented in the following sections support Himmelmann's conclusions about a common source of attributive marking originating from pronouns or other deictic elements used as attributive nominalizers.

\subsection{Attributive nominalizers in Uralic and Turkic}\label{uralic-turkic diachr}

Juxtaposition has been the prototype of adjective attributive marking in all Uralic and Turkic languages since the proto-stages of these languages (cf.~\citealt[80–81]{decsy1990} for Uralic and \citealt[75–76]{decsy1998} for Turkic). As the result of a secondary development, however, in some branches of Uralic and Turkic, an attributive nominalizer grammaticalized. Synchronically, it occurs as minor attribution marking device in specially marked noun phrase types in several languages of these two families.%{decsy1998}sagt eigentlich nichts zu Kongruenz

In the Saamic and Finnic branches of Uralic, juxtaposition has been replaced completely by new adjective attribution marking devices. In proto-Saamic the prototypical attributive connector of adjectives was probably anti-construct state marking. A comparison of synchronic evidence across modern Saamic languages makes this reconstruction very likely  \citep{riesler2006b}. However, all modern Saami languages show a strong tendency to abandon the anti-construct state marker and re-introduce the morphologically unmarked adjective attribution marking device juxtaposition. In proto-Finnic, the original Uralic type has also been lost and is now replaced by head-driven agreement marking of attributive adjectives. In sections \ref{Finnic diachr} and \ref{saamic diachr}, the emergence of agreement in Finnic and anti-construct state marking in Saamic will be explored and describes as a possible result of the grammaticalization of attributive nominalizers. 

Since the emergence of attributive nominalizers in Udmurt (and other modern Uralic languages) probably reflect structurally similar stages of development as those assumed for proto-Saamic and proto-Finnic, the Udmurt case will be described in-depth in the following sections.

\subsubsection{The contrastive focus marker in Udmurt} \label{udmurt diachr}

Synchronic data from Udmurt illustrates the emergence of an attributive article and might even indicate how this attribution marker has been generalized as an anti-construct state marker. 

The use of the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person possessive suffix as a contrastive focus marker in Udmurt was exemplified in Section \ref{udmurt synchr} on the synchrony of attribution marking in Permic. In the following sections, the etymological source and the evolution of this contrastive-focus construction will be illustrated with the help of further examples.

As in several other Uralic languages, the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular in Udmurt is often used as a definite-like marker. Grammatical descriptions of Udmurt use different terms to define the function of this formative, for example as “determinative” \citep{kelmakov-etal1999}, “contrastive-deictic” \citep{alatyrev1970}, “anaphorical-emphasizing” \citep{kiekbaev1965}, or simply “definite” \citep{winkler2001}. The suffix is characterized in the following as “quasi-definite” since Udmurt (as most other Uralic languages) has no morphologized feature \textsc{species}. The use of the marker is obviously determined by the referential status of the noun phrase, but it does not occur obligatorily in definite noun phrases. Since the rules for definiteness marking are not subject of the present investigation, the formative in definite-like constructions will simply be referred to as \textit{determinative suffix}, which is also consistent with some of the grammatical descriptions mentioned above (e.g.~\citealt{kelmakov-etal1999}).

Besides its function as a possessive marker, the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular occurs not only in quasi-definite noun phrases but is even used as an (attributive) nominalizer and as a marker of contrastive-focus on adjectives. From a synchronic point of view, the functions of \textsc{poss:3sg} in the different non-possessive uses are probably better analyzed as belonging to different grammatical categories. Consequently, different glosses (such as \textsc{poss, def, nmlz, contr}) should be applied. In order to illustrate the similar historical source of the synchronically differentiated grammatical meanings, however, one and the same gloss (i.e.~\textsc{poss:3sg}) is used in the following examples.

\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The use of the suffix \textit{-ėz} as marker of contrastive focus is obviously connected to its other non-possessive functions. The order of examples (\ref{udmurt possmarking}) through (\ref{udmurt diachr contr}) probably reflects the functional expansion of the original possessive mar\-ker to a “determinative” marker on noun phrases and a contrastive focus marker on adjectives. The clue for understanding this development is the use of the suffix \textit{-ėz} as an attributive nominalizer in headless noun phrases, as shown in (\ref{udmurt diachr nomzr}). Here, the determinative suffix is used as a true attributive nominalizer to mark a demonstrative (\ref{udmurt diachr dem-nomzr}), a genitive possessor noun (\ref{udmurt diachr gen-nomzr}) or an adjective (\ref{udmurt diachr adj-nomzr}) as modifiers by projecting a full (headless) noun phrase. Note however that headless demonstratives, genitives, and adjectives are not obligatorily marked by means of attributive nominalization in Udmurt. The marker is used in order to emphasize the property denoted by the attribute and to contrast it to other properties of the same set.

The emphasizing function of the determinative suffix, finally, is the link to its use as contrastive-focus marker on adjectives. It seems obvious that these contrastive-focus constructions originate from appositive constructions of nouns with emphasized headless attributes.\footnote{The zero-morpheme (equipped with the nominalizer Ø-\textsc{nmlz}) in (\ref{udmurt apposition}) is only presented for a better illustration of the empty head position to which the (nominalized) adjective moves in this appositive noun phrase.}

%\end{exe}
The agreement patterns in noun phrases with contrastive-focused attributes provide the best evidence for this assumption. In their default use, attributive adjectives (as well as other modifiers) do not show agreement with the head noun. However, when the attribute is marked for contrastive focus (by means of the attributive nominalizer \textsc{attr} $\Leftarrow$ \textsc{poss:3sg}), case and number marking spread to the adjective.

Following the intuition of the authors of grammatical description of Udmurt, however, one could also analyze these constructions as true noun phrases with a syntactic structure as in (\ref{udmurt notapposition}) (as opposed to \ref{udmurt apposition}) where the original nominalizer of the attribute in the headless noun phrase became a dependent marking attributive construct device linking the contras\-tive-\-focused attribute to the semantic head ‘house’ in the noun phrase.
\begin{exe}
\ex ? [$_{NP}$ $_{A}$big-\textsc{contr} $_{HEAD}$house]
\label{udmurt notapposition}
\end{exe}
Even if head-driven number and case agreement is involved in attribution marking of contrastive-focused adjectives, Udmurt is better analyzed as language exhibiting an attributive appositional construction rather than an anti-construct state agreement marking. The agreement and anti-construct marking formatives are not fused and agreement marking occurs only indirectly as the result of the nominalization of the apposed headless adjective.

\subsubsection[Possessive suffixes as attributive nominalizers]{Possessive suffixes as attributive nominalizers in other Uralic and in Turkic languages}

Non-possessive uses of 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffixes similar to Udmurt are well attested in several Uralic and Turkic languages.\footnote{In several languages, even 2\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive occurs in the same function.} In descriptions of these languages, the marker is often characterized as “emphatic-definite” or simply “definite” (cf.~\citealt[148]{tauli1966}; \citealt{kunnap2004}). But obviously this is far too simplified. It is especially unclear what it would mean to mark an adjectival modifier as “definite”.

Besides in Udmurt, the use of the (historical) 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix as a marker of contrastive focus is similarly regular (though less systematically described) in the other Permic languages (cf.~\citealt[67]{serebrennikov1963}). %Verweis ist sehr schlecht

In the Mari languages, which belong to the Volgaic branch of Uralic, the possessive suffix is also commonly used as a determinative suffix for nouns (cf.~\citealt[75–76]{alhoniemi1993}). The regular use of the formative to derive a certain set of “determinative” or contrastive focused demonstratives and quantifiers in Mari (similar to the Udmurt example (\ref{udmurt det dem}) on page \pageref{udmurt det dem}) gives at least some evidence that Mari has (or had) an attributive nominalizer in contrastive-focus constructions as well.\footnote{The homophone focus clitic \textit{=že} in Mari (\textit{təi=že kuze ilaš tüŋalat?} ‘And how are YOU going to live?’ \citealt[80]{alhoniemi1993}) is most likely not cognate with the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix but borrowed from the formally and functionally similar marker focus marker in Russian.}%anhand der deklinationsformen zeigen, dass es poss ist und nicht =že, z.B. weil kasus danach folgt%Verweis S. 80 ist falsch

\end{exe}
A similar use of the (historical) 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix as a marker of contrastive focus in the Turkic language Chuvash has been shown in Section \ref{chuvash synchr}. Interestingly, the Turkic language Chuvash and the Uralic languages Mari and Udmurt are among the core members of the Volga-Kama linguistic area.\footnote{Other core members of the Volga-Kama linguistic area are the Turkic languages Tatar and Bashkir. The Uralic languages Mordvin and Komi-Permyak are considered peripheral members \citep{helimski2005}.} The languages of this linguistic area show linguistic convergence on several levels of their grammars. In all Uralic and Turkic languages of that area, at least the “emphatic-definite” use of the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix is attested. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the evolving attributive nominalizer in Chuvash, Mari and Udmurt has been borrowed in either direction.%ÿsker

The phenomenon might even reflect a much older and more wide\-spread feature of a larger subarea of northern Eurasia including at least Tungusic. As demonstrated in the synchronic chapter on Tungusic (Section \ref{tungusic synchr}), similar constructions with the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix also seem to regularly occur in this family. Even in other languages of the area, examples of the use of the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix as an attributive nominalizer (though not on adjectives) are attested. Example (\ref{mongolian nmlz}) illustrates the use of the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix as an attributive nominalizer of pronouns in Khalkha Mongolian.

\ex	numaj ‘much’ – numajj\textbf{-i} ‘what is in majority; the largest part’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Not also that the (historical) 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix occurs in practically all Turkic languages in lexicalized local and temporal attributes. 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Chuvash} \citep[67-68]{benzing1963}

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
It remains unclear whether the evolution of attributive nominalization and contras\-tive-focus marking of attributive adjectives occurs independently in certain branches or areal groupings across Indoeuropean, Uralic, Turkic and Tungusic or goes back to a general northern Eurasian areal tendency.

\subsection{Attributive nominalizers in Indoeuropean} \label{ie diachr}

\subsubsection[Baltic and Slavic]{Attributive articles and the emergence of anti-construct state agreement marking in Baltic and Sla\-vic} \label{slavic diachr}

%The choice of one of these markers versus the other is normally connected to the definiteness or indefiniteness of the noun phrase in the Old Sla\-vic languages. 
%In Old Bulgarian attested definite noun phrases in which the adjective is marked with the short-suffix
%restrictions determined by semantic of the noun, referential status of the whole NP, but most clearly by the semantic of the adjective: So bilden Beziehungsadjective generell selten Langformen, die Possessivadjective im besonderen

%Another exception are nominalized adjectives in headless noun phrases which occur most often in the long form. (Mendoza)
%It is thus questionable whether or not the original function... really was marking of definiteness
%Mendoza: the opposition of long- versus short-form adjectives reflects restrictive versus non-restrictive use of attributes
%%reference semantic (Mendoza)
%%Def marker: regular expression of anaphoric definiteness of a noun phrase; has no further functions

Russian is the only Sla\-vic language exhibiting anti-construct state agree\-ment marking as the default and only type of attributive connection of adjectives (\textit{chorošij} \textsc{attr:nom.m.sg} ‘good’ versus \textit{choroš} \textsc{pred:nom.m.sg}, see also Section \ref{russian synchr}). The Russian construction in which attributive adjectives are obligatorily equip\-ped with special anti-construct state agreement suffixes resembles a construction in the closely related Baltic languages. In the latter, however, the occurrence of anti-construct state agreement marking is usually described as being restricted to definite noun phrases. The competition between complex attributive agreement and “pure” agreement marking was  already characteristic of Old Baltic (cf.~Lithuanian \textit{geràsis} versus \textit{g{\~e}ras}, Latvian \textit{labais} versus \textit{labs} ‘good’) and Old Sla\-vic languages (cf.~Old Bulgarian \textit{dobrъjь} versus \textit{dobrъ} ‘good’). Old Sla\-vic and Old Baltic languages are thus similar to modern Lithuanian and modern Latvian in exhibiting two types of adjective attribution marking suffixes in different functions.

In the Sla\-vic and Indoeuropean linguistic traditions, adjectives equipped with anti-construct state agreement marking are normally referred to as “long-form adjectives” (contrasted to “short-form adjectives”). Other commonly used terms for the anti-construct state agreement markers are “pronominal, complex” or “compound” agreement suffixes. Analogically, the two inflectional paradigms of long- versus short-form adjectives equipped with number-, gender-, and case agreement values are normally labeled in a similar way as “long-form, pronominal, complex, or compound” versus “short-form” adjective declension. Obviously, these terms describe the form or the origin of the formative rather than its function and are rather useless for a typological comparison.

Similar to the modern Baltic languages the markers are sometimes also labeled “definite” agreement suffixes in Old Sla\-vic. As will be shown below, the notion of “definiteness” does not exactly cover the functionality of the marker in Old Sla\-vic either.

The respective attributive constructions in modern Sla\-vic and Baltic languages have already been dealt with in the synchronic part of this investigation (especially in Sections \ref{slavic synchr} and \ref{baltic synchr}). In the present chapter, the origin and development of anti-construct state agreement marking in Baltic and Sla\-vic along two possible grammaticalization paths (see (\ref{2paths}) below) will be discussed. It will be argued that these constructions have arisen from attributive articles which originally marked contrastive focus of the attribute rather than from nominal relative constructions. Before dealing with the syntactic evolution of the attributive constructions in Slavic and Baltic, however, the etymology of the formative (which is similar for both scenarios) will be sketched in the following short section.

\paragraph{Etymology of the formative} 
Whereas the “pure” agreement declension (of the so-called short-forms) of adjectives continues the proto-Indoeuropean default type of adjective attribution marking, the anti-construct (long-form) agreement suffixes, as in Lithuanian \textit{geràs-is žmõgus}, Latvian \textit{laba-is cilvēks}, or Old Bulgarian \textit{dobrъ-jь človekъ} ‘the good person’, arose as a result of a phonological merger between the short-form agreement suffixes of the adjective and a pronominal stem reconstructed as proto-Baltic/\-proto-Sla\-vic \textit{*-jь-}.

This pronominal part of the long-form agreement suffix likely goes back to a pronominal stem reconstructed as proto-Indoeuropean \textit{*i̭o-} \citep[61]{wissemann1958}. The anti-construct state agreement marker in Balto-Sla\-vic could thus be cognate with relative markers in other Indoeuropean languages, such as Old Indic \textit{yá-h}, Old Iranian \textit{yō}, or Greek \textit{ős} \cite[53]{heinrichs1954}.

An alternative etymology has been suggested by Mikkola (\citeyear[52]{mikkola1950}; %verweis falsch
 see also \citealt[102]{leskien1871}; \citealt[164–165]{leskien1919}; \citealt[19ff.]{wijk1935}). Mikkola believes that proto-Slavic \textit{*-jь-} was an anaphoric marker which goes back to the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular pronoun (cf.~Lithuanian \textit{jìs}, \textit{jõ} \textsc{3sg:gen} or Old Bulgarian \textit{jъ}, \textit{jego} \textsc{3sg:gen}). The phonological merger of Indoeuropean \textit{*is} \textsc{3sg.m} with \textit{\textit{*i̭os}} \textsc{m} ‘which’ in Balto-Sla\-vic \cite[21 Footnote 8]{schmidt1959} makes this explanation possible from the point of view of sound correspondence.

The terminus post quem of the innovative attribution marking in Baltic and Sla\-vic can be determined relatively easily. Different phonological and morphological developments of the long-form agreement suffixes in Baltic and Sla\-vic imply that the phonological merger of adjective and the formative \textit{*-jь-} took place independently in Old Sla\-vic and Old Baltic \citep[64–65]{koch1992}. 

It is not certain whether the Baltic and Sla\-vic branches of Indoeuropean go back to a common proto-form or proto-Baltic and proto-Sla\-vic have to be reconstructed as independent Indoeuropean daughter languages. If the latter case proves to be right, the rise of anti-construct state agreement marking must be the result of parallel but independent developments in proto-Baltic and proto-Sla\-vic (as stated, for example, by \citealt[77]{pohl1980}). Since the reconstruction of proto-languages is not an aim of this investigation and since the developments in Baltic and Sla\-vic are similar from a chronological, functional and (Indoeuropean) etymological point of view, discussing the rise of anti-construct state agreement marking in Baltic and Sla\-vic together in the same section makes perfect sense.

\paragraph{Evolution of the construction} 
It is commonly assumed that the function of the long-form suffix on the adjective in Old Baltic and Old Sla\-vic was to mark the noun phrase as definite. This opinion is repeated by practically all authors of comparative grammars and reference books of the Balto-Sla\-vic languages as well as in works dealing specifically with adjectives and noun phrase syntax of these languages (cf.~\citealt[211]{mendoza2004} with references).

Definite nouns, however, are not obligatorily modified by long-form adjectives in Old Sla\-vic. Furthermore, nominalized (headless) adjectives are normally equipped with long-form suffixes, regardless of the referential status of the noun phrase as definite or indefinite. The analysis of the long-form adjective suffix as definite marker might thus not be as straightforward as it appears in the reference books. 

\citet[214–215]{mendoza2004} connects the original distribution of long- versus short-forms to the restrictive versus non-restrictive semantics of the attribute instead of the referential status of the modified noun. \citet{tolstoj1957}, who sees the main function of the long-form adjectives likewise in setting a certain property of a referent apart from properties of the rest of similar referents, could be interpreted in a similar way.

The later re-interpretation of such restrictive expressions as definite and even the generalization of the original restrictive adjective marker to a marker of anaphoric reference of the modified noun seems functionally plausible. There is no indication, however, that the long-form agreement suffixes morphologized to true definite markers in the Old Sla\-vic languages. Even in the modern stages of the South-Sla\-vic languages Slovenian and Serbo-Croatian, were remnants of the two different adjective inflections still occur, the so-called definite (long-form) declension of adjectives is semantically restricted to certain adjectival subclasses (see Section \ref{s-slavic synchr}). 

Furthermore, in Bulgarian and Macedonian, which are the only modern Sla\-vic languages exhibiting a fully morphologized category \textsc{species}, the respective definite marking does not originate from the long-form adjectives. This is true despite the fact that the long-form agreement marking in Old Bulgarian (i.e.~the ancestor language of Modern Bulgarian and Modern Macedonian) is attested to have almost grammaticalized as a marker of anaphoric reference of the noun phrase.

Note also that even the morphological status of the so-called definite adjectives in the modern Baltic languages has been doubted. It has sometimes been argued that the long-form adjective in Lithuanian might convey emphasis rather than definiteness, at least in certain expressions (cf.~\citealt[181–182]{kramsky1972}).

Even though the long-form agreement suffixes in Old Baltic and Old Sla\-vic show some functional extension to markers of anaphoric reference or even definiteness of the noun phrase, this development is secondary. The original function of the long-form agreement suffixes was to mark an adjectival attribute in an emphatic or contrastive-focus construction. Consequently, the suffix \textit{*-jь-} in proto-Baltic/\-proto-Sla\-vic has to be analyzed as an attribution marker on the adjective rather than as a marker of definiteness of the modified noun.

Leaving the question about the further development of the anti-con\-struct state agreement marker \textit{*-jь-} in different Baltic and Sla\-vic languages aside, two opposing theories about its original function and the assumed functional developments of the anti-construct state agreement marker in Baltic and Sla\-vic will be discussed in the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scenario 1:} The formative \textsc{attr} arose from a relative pronoun, hence:\\
\textsc{dem $\Rightarrow$ rel $\Rightarrow$ attr}
\item \textbf{Scenario 2:} The formative \textsc{attr} arose from an attributive article, hence:\\
\textsc{dem $\Rightarrow$ nmlz $\Rightarrow$ attr}
\label{2paths}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Scenario 1: Nominal relative constructions in proto-Balto-Sla\-vic} According to the first theory, the attributive marker in Baltic and Sla\-vic originates from a relative pronoun. This theory seems to be widely accepted since Delbrück's and Brugmann's (cf.~\citealt[432–433]{delbruck1893}; \citealt[331, 344]{brugmann-etal1916}) statements on the question. Their argumentation has been taken up and augmented with new data by \citet{schmidt1959}, \citet{koch1992,koch1999} and others. Koch argues that a reflex of the proto-Indoeuropean relative pronoun \textit{*(h)i̭o-} is attested as an attributive marker of adjectival, possessive, and adverbial modifiers of nouns in proto-Balto-Sla\-vic. He describes the constructions in which these attributes occur as “nominal relative constructions” \cite[470, elsewhere]{koch1999}.

The most substantial part in Koch's argumentation seems to be the similar use of cognate relative pronouns as polyfunctional markers in relative constructions as attested in Old Iranian and Old Indo-Aryan languages.

\end{exe}
Koch's (\citeyear[53, elsewhere]{koch1992}) main arguments for the old age of the relative function of \textit{*(h)i̭o-} in proto-Indoeuropean are found in attested cognate markers. In several Indoeuropean languages, the historical \textit{*(h)i̭o-} pronoun marks similar relative constructions as in the Old Persian examples (\ref{ez oldpersian}). Koch does not disprove, however, the assumption that the relative function of the pronoun derives from the deictic-anaphorical marking by means of a demonstrative. In fact, the Old Persian examples (\ref{ez oldpersian}) clearly show verb-less relative constructions linked to the head noun with an attributive article.
%According to Benveniste %GET CITE FROM Koch1992p57 (cf.~even \cite[PAGE]{lehmann1984}) are not originate leitet sich der idg. Relativsatz nicht aus satzartigen Vorgängern ab sondern aus verblosen Nominalsyntagmen%
%%%%%two relative pronouns reconstructed for the Indoeuropean proto-language: \textit{*(h)i̭o-} and \textit{*k\textsuperscript{ṷ}i-/\-*k\textsuperscript{ṷ}o-}
%%The relative function of the second pronoun \textit{*k\textsuperscript{ṷ}i-/\-*k\textsuperscript{ṷ}o-} clearly derives from its indefinite or interrogative meaning (KOCH, cf.~German \textit{welch-} English \textit{which} \textsc{interrog, rel}). 

Furthermore, it is not certain whether the old pronoun (or article) \textit{*(h)i̭o-} was inherited into proto-Baltic/\-proto-Sla\-vic. The pronominal stem is attested in Baltic or Sla\-vic only as the base of some derived connectors \cite[56]{heinrichs1954}. Even though the etymological pronoun seems to be preserved in the stem of the Old Bulgarian relative marker \textit{jь-že}, the function of this marker is clearly yielded by the emphatic particle \textit{-že} \cite[56]{heinrichs1954}.  %Zitat falsch
  The old relative pronoun seems to be completely lost in Old Baltic where different relative markers occur (as in Lithuanian \textit{ku\~rs} $\Leftarrow$ \textit{kurìs}, Latvian \textit{kuŕš} noted by \citealt[15]{schmidt1959}).

\citet[468, 470]{koch1999} dates the original relative construction back to an early pre-proto-Baltoslavic age. According to him, the relative pronoun did not agree in case with the head noun in the inherited Indoeuropean relative construction (\ref{koch rel}). Such morpho-syntactic behavior would in fact be expected from a true relative pronoun. But according to Koch's reconstruction (\ref{koch nomzr}), case agreement between a head noun and a relative pronoun was already present in proto-Baltoslavic. Finally, the long-form agreement inflection arose independently as a result of the phonological merger of the adjective and the original pronoun in Old Baltic and Old Sla\-vic (\ref{koch attr}). Most crucial in this reconstruction is the fact that the assumed original relative pronoun has obviously never marked a true relative clause construction in proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic.

This assumed development presupposes the transition of original “nominal relative constructions” in pre-proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic (step 1) to a construction with an attributive article (\textsc{nmlz}) in proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic as an intermediate step (2). The anti-construct (“long-form”, i.e.~\textsc{attr}) agreement marking arose as a last step (3) in Old Baltic and Old Sla\-vic.

Koch's reconstruction gives no conclusive arguments for the existence of “nominal relative constructions” marked with a relative pronoun \textit{*(h)i̭o-} in pre-proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic. Theoretically, the attributive nominalization construction (step 2) could be much older and be the primary one in Indoeuropean. The corresponding “nominal relative constructions” in Indo-Aryan and Iranian might just as well originate from attributive nominalization constructions. The Indoeuropean relative pronoun \textit{*(h)i̭o-} would than go back to a deictic pronoun, probably \textit{*i-} ($\Rightarrow$ Latin, Gothic \textit{is} \textsc{dem}) which was used as attributive article as early as in proto-Indoeuropean.

%also The question of word order is left open in Koch's reconstruction. In the examples \ref{koch rel} through \ref{koch nomzr} the attribute is marked by a postponed pronoun and follows the noun. In the Old Iranian and Old Indo-Aryan languages, in which the assumed cognate relative pronoun is attested, 
%the attribute also follows the noun but the relative marker occurs between the constituents.

\paragraph{Scenario 2: Attributive nominalizing constructions in proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic} 
According to the second idea about the emergence of the long-form adjectives in Balto-Sla\-vic, the attributive marker was originally an article. One opponent of the “relative” theory is van Wijk, who believes 
\begin{quote}
[\dots] dass wir fürs Slavische vollständig auskommen ohne die Annahme relativer Pronominalformen vom idg. Stamme \textit{i̭e/i̭o-}, und dass dasselbe für das Baltische gilt \citep[28]{wijk1935}.
\end{quote}
%%\cite{otrebski1968} sieht in –j- der pronominalen Flexionsformen die Fortsetzung einer "hervorhebenden Partikel"
Leaving open whether an attributive article or a relative pronoun constitutes the ultimate origin of the anti-construct state agreement in pre-proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic, Koch's reconstruction would in fact be compatible with Wijk's “article theory”. The attribute nominalizing construction with the pronominal marker \textit{*-jь-} as attributive article in proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic is clearly reflected in step 2 of Koch's reconstruction (examples \ref{koch nomzr} and \ref{koch constit nomzr}). The final step 3 in which the attributive nominalizer becomes an anti-construct state marker is completely similar to the development assumed by \cite{wijk1935}.

The most plausible functional explanation of the grammaticalization of the pronominal marker \textit{*-jь-} into an attributive article is formulated by Wissemann (\citeyear{wissemann1958}). He argues that the original function of the anti-construct (“long-form”) agreement suffixes was that of a “Gelenkspartikel” \citep[76]{wissemann1958}, i.e.~an \textit{attributive article} or \textit{attributive nominalizer} in terms of the present study. Wissemann also shows that the function as anaphoric (“quasi-definite”) noun phrase marker is secondary.

Another argument in favor of the attributive nominalizing function of the proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic attributive article \textit{*-jь-} can be found in its polyfunctional use with different types of attributes. Besides marking the attributive connection of (emphasized) adjectives and participles, the article also served to mark some non-adjectival (and originally non-agreeing) attributes, such as adverbial and genitive phrases.

\citet[467–468]{koch1999} gives a list of lexicalized attributive expressions in which \textit{*-jь-} occurs as an attributive marker. These examples of frozen nominalizations present evidence of the original attributive nominalizing function of the proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic article.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textbf{Scenario 2:} \textsc{dem $\Rightarrow$ nmlz $\Rightarrow$ attr}
\end{exe}
Koch's examples provide the best arguments for the opposite assumption that attributive nominalizing constructions are the source of that marker.

\subsubsection[Germanic]{Attributive nominalizers and the emergence of anti-construct state agreement marking in Germanic} \label{germanic diachr}
As in the Balto-Sla\-vic languages, the emergence of attributive nominalizers in Germanic is functionally connected to the rise of definiteness marking. In Modern Baltic and some South-Sla\-vic languages, the occurrence of anti-construct state agreement marking is restricted to (semantically) definite noun phrases. This functional devision between “true” head-driven agreement and anti-con\-struct state agreement marking was already characteristic of all Old Baltic and Old Sla\-vic languages. 

As in the proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic languages, a secondary inflectional para\-digm of adjectives was innovated in proto-Germanic. This so-called weak adjective declension has often been described as the first definite marking device in Germanic (e.g.~by \citealt{heinrichs1954} and \citealt[170]{ringe2006}) because its use was restricted to (semantically) definite noun phrases. Semantic definiteness, however, was never marked obligatorily in any of the Old Germanic languages. Even though demonstrative pronouns were sometimes used in semantically definite phrases, definite markers had not yet been grammaticalized in Old Germanic varieties. Examples from Old Germanic text sources show that the use of both demonstratives and “weak adjectives” in definite phrases was optional (cf.~\citealt{philippi1997}; \citealt{heinrichs1954}).

Only the modern Germanic languages exhibit true definite markers and thus a grammaticalized feature \textsc{species}. But the so-called definite articles of modern Germanic languages originate from etymological sources which were different from the older anti-construct state agreement marking suffixes. Following \citet[267–268]{riesler2006a}, the rise of the Germanic “weak” adjective declension is here explained as a result of attributive nominalization. 
\begin{exe}
\ex “Strong” and “weak” agreement in \textsc{proto-Germanic} \citep[169]{ringe2006}
\begin{xlist}
\ex	Head-driven (“strong”) agreement
\gll *k\textsuperscript{w}ik\textsuperscript{w}a-\\

\ex	Anti-construct state (“weak”) agreement
\gll *k\textsuperscript{w}ik\textsuperscript{w}a\textbf{-n-}\\
quick:\textsc{m.sg.nom}\textbf{\textsc{-nmlz-}}\\
\glt	‘quick’
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The pre-proto-Germanic formative marking “weak” agreement is sometimes described as an “individualizing” or “nominalizing” suffix of nominals (i.e. adjectives and, perhaps, nouns as well). These functions are reflected in (nick-) names, such as Greek \textit{ágáthōn} ‘the Good’ ($\leftarrow$ \textit{ágáthós} ‘good’) or Latin \textit{Catō} ‘the Shrewd’ ($\leftarrow$ \textit{catus} ‘shrewd’) which are also derived from nouns equipped with the cognate suffix \textit{*-n-} \citep[170]{ringe2006}.\footnote{Names such as Latin \textit{Marcus Catō, Ovidius Nasō} are interpreted as ‘Marcus the cunning’ and ‘Ovidius the nose’ \citep[6–7]{nocentini1996}.}

Some scholars have reconstructed a pronominal stem extension \textit{*-en-/-on-} as the origin of the suffix (for example \citealt[52]{mikkola1950} and \citealt[67]{heinrichs1954}). Others express their doubt about the pronominal origin of this marker (for example \citealt[21 Footnote 6]{schmidt1959}). But even without a definitely reconstructed etymology of the formative, the construction clearly shows similarities with the attributive nominalization of adjectives in proto-Baltic/Sla\-vic. It thus seems relatively safe to follow Mikkola (\citeyear{mikkola1950}) and Heinrichs ({\citeyear{heinrichs1954}) in assuming that the weak adjective declension in Germanic goes back to a construction with an attributive nominalizer.

\citet[170]{ringe2006} finds it “reasonable to hypothesize that the \textit{n-}stem suffix of the weak adjective paradigm was originally a definite article”. But this hypothesis must be rejected because the marker was never obligatory in definite contexts. Similar to Baltic and Sla\-vic, it seems much more plausible to assume that the article was never a true definiteness marker. It can rather be assumed that the clue for understanding the origin of the “weak” adjective declension in Germanic is the nominalizing function of the \textit{article}, which originally marked an (emphatically-contrasted) adjective as an appositional attribute.

The rise of anti-construct state agreement marking of attributive adjectives in Germanic thus followed a similar grammaticalization path as in Baltic and Sla\-vic.\footnote{The zero-morpheme (equipped with the nominalizer Ø-\textsc{nmlz}) in (\ref{germanic gram1}) and following examples is only presented for a better illustration of the empty head position to which the (nominalized) adjective moves in the appositive noun phrase.}

During Stage 1 (\ref{germanic1}), the attributive nominalizer (i.e.~the pronominal stem extension \textit{*-en-/-on-}) competed with the default adjective attribution marking device (i.e.~the inherited Indoeuropean head-driven agreement) but was restricted only to emphatic attributive appositional constructions. This stage can be dated back to proto-Germanic at the latest. In all Old Germanic languages, the original attributive appositional construction is reanalyzed as a true noun phrase in which the former attributive nominalizer marks a con\-trastive-focused adjective. The secondary attribution marking device still competed with the default adjective attribution marking device (i.e.~head-driven agreement during Stage 2 (\ref{germanic2}). The competition between the two different adjective attribution marking devices was dissolved during Stage 3 (\ref{germanic3}). This stage is reflected by the modern West-Germanic languages where only one type of adjective attribution marking occurs. Due to the fact that agreement inflection of adjectives in modern West-Germanic languages (except English) only marks attributive but not predicative adjectives, this adjective attribution marking de\-vice has been characterized as anti-construct state agreement (Section~\ref{w-germanic synchr}).

\subsection[Definite noun phrases in Germanic]{Excursus: Definite noun phrases in Germanic}
In the previous section, it was shown that the grammaticalization of the feature \textsc{species} (definiteness) in Germanic is a relatively recent phenomenon which is not directly connected to the rise of attributive nominalization and anti-construct state agreement marking (so-called “weak” or “definite” agreement). Even though anti-construct state agreement usually occurred in semantically definite noun phrases, true definite markers evolved much later.

The etymological source of the definite markers were local-deictic (demonstrative) pronouns: proto-Germanic \textit{*sa, *sō, *þat}, in North-Germanic additionally also \textit{en, enn, et} \citep[15]{heinrichs1954}. Interestingly, the evolving definite markers from the first set of proto-Germanic demonstratives were also first used as attribution markers of adjectives  \citep{gamillscheg1937, nocentini1996}. Later, the use of the articles was extended from appositive (nominalized) adjectives to whole noun phrases \citep[63]{philippi1997}. If the grammaticalization path illustrated in (\ref{germanic gram1}) is extended with one more stage, the evolution of definiteness marking in Germanic can be included as well. Note that the additional developments in the grammaticalization path (\ref{germanic gram2}) are also partly connected to adjective attribution.

Note that an attributive apposition construction for marking emphasis occurs twice in the illustrated grammaticalization path (\ref{germanic gram2}). In Stage 1 (\ref{germanic art1}), the attributive nominalizer is the pronominal stem extension \textit{*-en-/-on-} which becomes the anti-constract state agreement marker in the following stage (\ref{germanic ACAgr}). The second attributive nominalizer in Stage 3 (\ref{germanic art2}) is the demonstrative pronoun which becomes the definite marker in the following stage (\ref{germanic def}). These two attributive nominalizers have different etymological sources and attach to different positions inside the noun phrase but they are functional equivalents.

Stage 4 in example (\ref{germanic gram2}) did not fully affect North-Germanic. Instead, the Old North-Germanic languages (Old East- and Old West-Norse) grammaticalized definite markers from the demonstratives \textit{en, enn, et} \citep[15]{heinrichs1954}. These markers are the complete morpho-syntactic opposites of West-Germanic: Unlike the West-Germanic preposed and free form definite marker, all modern North-Germanic standard languages exhibit a postposed definite noun inflection. The different morpho-syntactic realization of the general Germanic tendency towards grammaticalization of definiteness is best explained as contact-induced change due to Saamic influence in North-Germanic \citep{kusmenko2008}.
\begin{exe}

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that in North-Germanic Stage 4 (\ref{ngermanic def}) the former preposed nominalizer (article) did not grammaticalize into a true definite marker like in West-Germanic but into an anti-construct state agreement marker. The noun phrase structure is thus different from Stage 3 (\ref{germanic art2}) because the attributive apposition of a the nominalized headless adjective is lost and the semantic head of the overall noun phrase is syntactically reunited with its adjectival modifier.

Synchronic data from different North Germanic varieties reflect intermediate stages in the evolution of definite noun phrase structure. This cross-linguistic variation is most likely the result of competing grammaticalization of a preposed article and a postposed definite inflection \citep{dahl2003}. 

As with all modern West-Germanic languages,\footnote{In English, the noun phrase structure is similar in theory, with the exception of headless adjectives which are obligatorily nominalized: \textit{the good \textbf{one}}, cf.~Section \ref{w-germanic synchr}.} the West-Jutlandic dialect of Danish exhibits phrasal definite marking by means of a phonologically free and preposed definite article.
\begin{exe}

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
In several of the northernmost North-Germanic varieties, definiteness is also marked phrasally but by means of a phonologically bound and postposed formative. Consequently, the phrasal definite marker attaches as suffix to definite nouns and definite headless adjectives alike. Note also that adjectives are incorporated into (or compounded with) the head noun. 
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Västerbotten-Swedish}\footnote{The examples are constructed according to \cite{astrom1893}, cf.~also Delsing (\citeyear[122–123]{delsing1993}) and \cite{dahl2003}.}

In the North-Germanic languages Norwegian\footnote{New- and Dano Norwegian} and Swedish as well as in Faro\-ese, the definite marker is an inflectional suffix as in Västerbotten-Swedish, i.e.~pho\-nologically bound and postposed. The formative is, however, exclusively a noun marker and does not show up on headless adjectives in definite noun phrases. The latter are not overtly marked as definite but show circum-positioned definite agreement marking by means of a preposed attributive article and definite agreement inflection.

In Danish and (colloquial) Icelandic, the definite marker has two allomorphs: an inflectional noun suffix similar to Swedish (i.e.~a phonologically bound and postposed) and a definite article similar to the West-Germanic languages (i.e.~phonologically free and preposed). Interestingly, the allomorphy of the definite marker in Danish and Icelandic is triggered by the part-of-speech membership of the host: Whereas the bound allomorph selects for nouns, the free form selects for adjectives.

\paragraph{“Double definiteness” and a “buffer zone” in North-Germanic}\label{buffer}
The geographic distribution of different morpho-syntactic types of definiteness marking across North-Germanic reveals interesting areal patterns. The occurrence of adjective incorporation coincides with the area of the missing preposed article. Both features are characteristic of the northeastern periphery of North Germanic (\citealt{delsing1996b}, cf. also \citealt{riesler2001a,riesler2002a}; for adjective incorporation cf.~also Map \ref{Delsing9}). The structural connection between adjective incorporation and the missing preposed article is obvious: The construction with the compounded (incorporated) adjective in definite noun phrases substitutes the respective construction with the preposed article in those dialects where a preposed article has not (yet) been developed from the former demonstrative. The northeastern North-Germanic data thus reflects an early Stage 3 in the illustrated grammaticalization path (\ref{germanic3}).

The northeastern North-Germanic dialect area constitutes the innovation center of the grammaticalization of a (suffixed) inflectional category \textsc{species} (definiteness). The southwestern North-Germanic dialects, located geographically at the very opposite periphery, exhibit a structurally reversed picture of northeastern North Germanic which is in its direction of evolution almost identical to the situation in West-Germanic.

Dahl describes the phrasal definite markers in southwestern and northeastern North-Germanic dialects as the result of structurally and geo\-graphically opposed processes of grammatical changes.
\begin{quote}
[T]he variation we can see in the attributive constructions is the result of the competition between them about the same territory \citep[147]{dahl2003}.
\end{quote}
The “competition” between northeastern and southwestern grammaticalization tendencies in Germanic is not restricted to definite marking. Several gram\-matical categories which developed as the result of common Germanic (or even Indoeuropean) tendencies, have grammaticalized into non-fusional (analytic) constructions in West-Germanic but into concatenate (synthetic) constructions in North-Germanic. Language contact with neighboring Uralic languages would offer the most plausible explanation for the structurally differentiated developments inside the Germanic branch. Consequently, Kusmenko (\citeyear{kusmenko2008}) proposed a model for explaining the morphological fusion of definiteness and other North-Germanic innovative categories as the result of interference features during the language shift of the assimilated Saami of Mediaeval Scandinavia.

A direct connection between language contact and the rise of adjective incorporation and the missing preposed adjective article in northeastern North-Germanic varieties was also suggested by \cite{riesler2001a,riesler2002a}. But even if this idea cannot be proven correct the historical connection between missing preposed adjective articles, adjective incorporation and the morpho-syntactic type of definiteness marking (i.e. morphologically fused and postposed) in the northeastern North-Germanic dialect area is obvious. Saamic influence (causing the morphological fusion of postposed definiteness marking) would thus at least be an indirect trigger of these areal grammaticalization phenomena in North-Germanic which can be described as a “buffer zone” \citep{stilo2005}.\footnote{Stilo created the term for a similar language area between competing grammaticalization tendencies due to contact induced-changes in the Southern Caucasus. The parallel between Stilo's “buffer zone” and Dahl's (\citeyear{dahl2003}) “competing” morpho-syntactic types in North-Germanic languages was first mentioned to the author by Tania Kuteva (pc). But neither Dahl nor Kuteva drew contact linguistic implications in the North-Germanic case. The idea about the North-Germanic “buffer zone” as an indirect result of contact-induced changes was first mentioned by \cite{riesler2006a}.}

\subsection[Attributive nominalization and anti-construct state]{Attributive nominalization and the grammaticalization of anti-construct state (agreement) marking}
The previous sections described how anti-construct state agreement marking arose in the Baltic, Sla\-vic and Germanic branches of Indoeuropean. Structurally similar developments were also described for Udmurt from the Permic branch of Uralic, in Chuvash and other so-called Uralo-Altaic languages in Section \ref{uralic-turkic diachr}. 

The emergence of attributive nominalizers such as secondary attribution markers seem to reflect a general tendency in several branches of Indoeuropean, Uralic and Turkic. The etymological source of the attributive nominalizer in all of these languages is either a local deictic determiner or the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person possessive marker with “determinative” functions.

Synchronic data from several languages of the Lezgian (Daghestanian) branch of Nakh-Daghestanian (Section \ref{lezgian synchr}) seem to reflect a similar grammaticalization path from deictics to attributive nominalizers. Most Lezgian languages sampled for the present study have juxtaposition as the default adjective attribution marking device. Attributive nominalization also occurs in most languages of this branch but is restricted to headless noun phrases. The attributive nominalizer is a stem augment \textit{-tV- / -dV-} which could be connected historically to the deictic pronouns occurring with similar shapes in these languages. In Budukh, the cognate suffix \textit{-ti} is not used as an attributive nominalizer but to emphasize “a high degree of quality”, cf.~\textit{godak} ‘short’ : \textit{godak-ti} ‘very short’ \citep[267]{alekseev1994b}. In Rutul, the cognate marker \textit{-d} is used as an anti-construct state marker on attributive adjectives as the default \citep[224]{alekseev1994a}. A different but nevertheless related function of the cognate marker is attested in Archi where the suffix \textit{-t̄u} derives adjectives from nouns, adverbs and postpositions \citep[318]{kibrik1994b}.

The Lezgian data needs further investigation, but it suggests a pattern where the dependend-marking attributive state evolves from attributive nominalization. It is also very obvious that the attri\-butive nominalizers in Uralic and Turkic have evolved along a similar grammaticalization path as the one described for several Indoeuropean (and other) languages by \cite{himmelmann1997}. Important differences between Himmelman's “linking articles” and the attributive nominalizers described here, however, are (1) the origin of the Uralic and Turkic nominalizers from person-deictic rather than from local-deictic markers and (2) the inflectional use of the markers in Uralic and Turkic as compared to their original adnominal use in Indoeuropean.

The data from Uralic and Turkic is especially interesting, since it contradicts Himmelmann's (\citeyear[220–221]{himmelmann1997}) assumption that a functional convergence between attributive nominalizers with a person-deictic or a local-deictic etymological source is unlikely to occur. Of central importance to Himmelmann's analyses is the “anamnestic” use of the deictic markers from which the articles are grammaticalized. According to Himmelmann, the use of “D(eictic) elements” in order to refer to properties the speaker believes to be well-known for her/his interlocutor is the most relevant precondition for their further grammaticalization into articles and definite markers. Whereas the “anamnestic” use is inherent in (local-deictic) demonstratives, the same is not true for (person-deictic) possessive markers. The further grammaticalization of demonstratives into functional determinative elements (like articles and definiteness markers in several Indoeuropean languages) is accompanied by a functional extension of an original “anamnestic” to an associative-anaphoric use of the markers. This is in contrast to the further grammaticalization of possessive markers into functional determinative elements (like attributive articles and quasi-definiteness markers in certain Uralic languages) which is accompanied by a functional extension from an original associative-anaphoric to “anamnestic” use.
\begin{quote}
D-Elemente breiten sich von pragmatisch-definiten Kontexten auf se\-mantisch-definite aus, während Possessivpronomina sich um\-ge\-kehrt von einem semantisch-definten Kontext auf einen bzw. meh\-re\-re pragmatisch-definite Kontexte ausdehnen \cite[221]{himmelmann1997}.
\end{quote}
Himmelmann's thesis regarding the opposite functional extension of person-deictics might still be valid and compatible with the Uralic and Turkic data. In those Uralic and Turkic languages with attested attributive nominalization, the definite (or quasi-definite) function of the possessive marker is also always present. It can therefore be assumed that the definite (or quasi-definite) use of the marker obligatorily occurs as an intermediate step during the grammaticalization of possessive markers to attributive nominalizers.
\begin{exe}
\ex Person-deictic source (Uralic, Turkic)\\
\textsc{poss $\Rightarrow$ def $\Rightarrow$ nmlz}
\end{exe}
In the Indoeuropean languages with attributive articles such an intermediate step is probably not necessary.
\begin{exe}
\ex Local-deictic source (Indoeuropean)\\
	\textsc{dem ($\Rightarrow$ def) $\Rightarrow$ nmlz}
\end{exe}
In fact, in the West-Germanic and South-Sla\-vic languages, definite markers evolve from attributive nominalizers but not vice versa. 
\begin{exe}
\ex Local-deictic source (West-Germanic, South-Sla\-vic)\\
	\textsc{dem $\Rightarrow$ nmlz ($\Rightarrow$ def)}
\end{exe}
This observation will be taken up again. If the tentative observation on the languages with “grammaticalized person-deictic elements” (i.e.~possessive markers as attributive nominalizers) proves right it would imply the following implicational universal:

%!!??check
%\begin{thm} \label{universal}
%Possessive markers develop into attributive nominalizers only in languages in which similar possessive markers are already used as markers of (quasi-) definiteness.
%\end{thm}

\noindent Whereas the etymology and the evolution of attribution markers in Indoeuropean has been described (more or less systematically) by different authors, much less has been written about the emergence of attribution markers in different Uralic and Turkic languages. The emergence of anti-construct state marking in Saamic, which has not been described at all, appears to be especially interesting in this respect.

\section[Anti-construct state in Saamic]{The emergence of anti-construct state marking in Saamic} \label{saamic diachr}

In Chapter \ref{udmurt diachr}, it was shown that the contrastive-focus marker in Udmurt most likely evolved from an attributive article. \cite{riesler2006b} suggested the idea that a similar construction was the ultimate source of anti-construct state marking in the languages of the relatively closely related Saamic branch of Uralic. Since this theory about the rise of attribution marking in Saamic is based on a controversial idea, it calls for a relatively detailed discussion which will be presented in the following sections.

In Section \ref{saami synchr}, it was shown that adjectives in all Saamic languages are normally marked morpho-syntactically by means of differentiated attributive and predicative state markers. Even though the system of attributive and predicative marking is highly irregular in the Saamic languages, it can be shown that the attributive forms of adjectives are prototypically marked with a suffix (Northern Saami) \textit{-s}. This suffix constitutes a prototypical example of an anti-construct state marker, i.e.~a dependent marking attributive morpheme.

The origin of anti-construct state marking in Saamic is controversial. The suffix \textit{-s} is definitely not inherited from proto-Uralic. It is probably not borrowed from any of the known current or historical contact languages of Saamic either. Considering this as well as the fact that Saamic is a rare instance among the Northern-Eurasian languages in exhibiting anti-construct state marking on adjectives, relatively little attention has been paid to explaining its origin.

\subsection{State of research}

The different proposed theories which explain the origin of the anti-construct state marker on adjectives in Saamic can be subsumed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Grammatical borrowing from Indoeuropean
\item Functional extension of an adjective derivational marker
\item Grammaticalization from an attributive nominalizer.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The idea about a grammaticalization from an attributive nominalizer presented by Nielsen (\citeyear{nielsen1933}) and Atányi (\citeyear{atanyi1942,atanyi1943}) is the only contribution to the subject spelled out in certain detail. Interestingly enough, the idea has been rejected as “hardly convincing” (my translation) in a one-sentence-statement in Korhonen's (\citeyear{korhonen-m1981}) historical grammar of Saami. Korhonen's judgement that the origin of the attributive suffix in Saamic is still unclear \cite[246]{korhonen-m1981} seems to reflect the state of research up to today. Neither of the three hypotheses mentioned above has been discussed seriously in Saami or Uralic historical linguistics.\footnote{An exception is a short article by \cite{sarv-m2001} who presents the different ideas but does not come to conclusive results.}. All proposed hypothesis will be evaluated.

\paragraph{Loan adjectives} Trond Trosterud (pc) has suggested that the attributive suffix in Saamic origins from an ending typical of proto-Germanic loan adjectives in Saami. The Saamic suffix \textit{-s} would then reflex the (pre-rhotacism) form of the proto-Germanic case suffix \textit{-R} for masculine nominative singular which was adopted into proto-Saamic together with loan adjectives. According to this hypothesis (which is not discussed in any publication so far) the adjective ending \mbox{\textit{-s}} occurred originally on Germanic loan adjectives but was later generalized and used with inherited adjectives as well. In fact, a considerable number of Germanic loan adjectives with the corresponding ending \textit{-s} < proto-North-Germanic \textit{-R} \textsc{m.nom.sg} is attested in Saamic, for instance:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Northern Saami \textit{smáves} ‘small’ $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*smāv̀e̮} < proto-North-Germanic; cf.~Old Norse \textit{smalr} \textsc{m} (or a more recent North-Germanic borrowing; cf.~Swedish \textit{sm\aa}; \citealt[263]{sammallahti1998b})
\item Lule Saami \textit{riukas} ‘far-reaching’ < proto-North-Germanic, cf.~Old Norse \textit{drùgr}, Norwegian \textit{drjug} \cite[267]{qvigstad1893}
\item Lule Saami \textit{lines} ‘soft, yielding, mild’ < proto-North-Germanic, cf.~Old Norse \textit{linr}, Norwegian \textit{lin} \cite[218]{qvigstad1893}
\item Northern Saami \textit{luov\.{o}s $\sim$ luovus} ‘loose, not tied’ $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*luovōs $\sim$ *luove̮s} < proto-North-Germanic \textit{*lauss} \textsc{m} (where the suffix \textit{-R} is assimilated into /s/) \cite[264]{sammallahti1998b}
\item Northern Saami \textit{suohtas} ‘fun, nice’ $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*suohte̮s} < proto-Germanic \textit{*swōtu-} \cite[264]{sammallahti1998b}, cf.~Old Norse \textit{*søtr} \textsc{m} 
\item Northern Saami \textit{viiddis} ‘wide, extensive’ $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*vij{\dh}ēs} < proto-North-Germanic \cite[148–149]{lehtiranta1989}, cf.~Old Norse \textit{v\'i{\dh}r} \textsc{m}
\end{itemize}

\noindent The sound change of proto-Germanic \textit{*-z} $\Rightarrow$ proto-North-Germanic \textit{-R} ($\Rightarrow$ Common North-Germanic \textit{-r}) took place around 500 AD. The hypothesis of the loan origin of the Saamic attributive suffix presupposes that the respective suffix in Germanic had a sound value [-z] (or ?[-s]). The exact sound value of \textit{-R}, however, is not at all certain. What is commonly accepted is that the sound was phonologically distinguished from /r/ \citep{skold1954}.

From the point of view of its etymology, the adjective ending \textit{-s} is identical to the ending \textit{-s} of some borrowed proto-Germanic nouns, such as proto-Saamic \textit{*vālās}, cf.~Northern Saami \textit{fàlis} ‘whale’ < proto-North-Germanic, cf.~Old Norse \textit{hvalr}, cf.~Norwegian \textit{hval} (\citealt[144]{qvigstad1893}; \citealt[144–145]{lehtiranta1989}) or proto-Saamic \textit{*kāllēs}, cf.~Northern Saami \textit{gállis} ‘old man’ < proto-Germanic \textit{*karilaz} \textsc{m} \cite[44–45]{lehtiranta1989}. The ending \textit{-s} in bisyllabic nominals is thus an indicator that the word in question might belong to the layer of proto-North-Germanic borrowings in Saamic.

In many instances of Germanic loan adjectives the ending \textit{-s}, however, marks only the predicative and not the attributive form, consider (from the list above):

\begin{itemize}
\item Northern Saami \textit{smávva} [small.\textsc{attr}] $\leftarrow$ \textit{smáves} ‘small’
\item Lule Saami \textit{riuka} [far-reaching.\textsc{attr}] $\leftarrow$ \textit{riukas} ‘far-reaching’
\item Lule Saami \textit{littna} [soft.\textsc{attr}] $\leftarrow$ \textit{lines} ‘soft’
\end{itemize}

\noindent Other loan adjectives have identical forms with the ending \textit{-s} in both predicative and attributive function:

\begin{itemize}
\item Northern Saami \textit{luov\.{o}s $\sim$ luovus} ‘loose'
\item Northern Saami \textit{suohtas} ‘fun, nice'
\item Northern Saami \textit{viiddis} ‘wide, extensive'
\end {itemize}

\noindent It is unclear whether the Germanic loan adjectives ending in \textit{-s} regularly occurred in both attributive and predicative positions already in proto-Saamic, or the ending \textit{-s} expanded from predicative to attributive forms, or vice versa.

The relatively regular occurrence of the ending \textit{-s} in the predicative forms suggests that the respective Germanic loan adjectives also ending in \textit{-s} were originally used to denote predicates rather than attributes. This seems reasonable from the point of view of the morpho-semantics of the borrowed Germanic adjectives as well. The ending \textit{-R} ($\Leftarrow$ \textit{*z}) marks masculine nominals only in the so-called strong declension and thus occurred more likely on predicative adjectives which normally denote temporary properties. Attributive adjectives in Germanic, by contrast, could be marked either by means of head-driven agreement (“strong declension”) or anti-construct state agreement (“weak declension”) depending on the semantic or referential status of the attribute. An adjective denoting a permanent property was normally marked with the anti-construct state agreement suffix (cf.~Section \ref{germanic diachr}).

Consequently, the Saamic ending \textit{-s} could have been borrowed exclusively from “strong” adjectives in masculine nominative singular, the only form which had the ending \textit{-R} ($\Leftarrow$ \textit{*z}) in proto-North-Germanic. It is thus doubtful that just the borrowed forms with \textit{-s} have been generalized as attributive forms by bilingual speakers in the assumed Saamic-Germanic language contact situation.\footnote{There is no doubt that language contact between speakers of proto-Saamic and proto-North-Germanic took place; cf.~\citealt{kusmenko2008}. It is, however, rather irrelevant to the case described here which contact scenario has to be assumed: borrowing proper or shift-induced interference in the Saamic L2 of original Germanic speakers.} It should thus be assumed that the Germanic loan etymology of certain adjectives in Saamic does not provide a clue for the origin of the attributive suffix. 

Another problem in the hypothesis of the Germanic origin of the Saamic adjective ending \textit{-s} might be the class of inherited Saamic adjectives which also have the ending \textit{-s} when used predicatively. Consider the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item Northern Saami \textit{báhkas} ‘hot’ $\leftarrow$ \textit{báhkka} [hot.\textsc{attr}] $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*pāhk\-e̮s} $\Leftarrow$ pre-proto-Saamic \textit{*pakka-} 'hot; cold’; cf.~Finnish \textit{pakkanen} ‘frost’ \cite[230]{sammallahti1998b}
\item Northern Saami \textit{garas} ‘hard’ $\leftarrow$ \textit{garra} [hard.\textsc{attr}] $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*ke̮\`re̮-} $\Leftarrow$ pre-proto-Saamic \textit{*kiri-}; cf.~Finnish \textit{kireä} ‘tight, tense’ \cite[242]{sammallahti1998b}
\item Northern Saami \textit{o{\dj}as} ‘new’ $\leftarrow$ \textit{o{\dj}{\dj}a} [new.\textsc{attr}] $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*o\`{\dh}e̮-} \cite[258]{sammallahti1998b}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Since the most typical proto-Saamic root can be reconstructed as an open bisyllabic,\footnote{Cf.~the list of reconstructed proto-Saamic lexemes in \cite{lehtiranta1989}.} the ending \textit{-s} of these predicative adjectives could not have belonged to the root originally. The ending-less attributive forms in the examples above would then reflect the original adjective roots, characterized as bisyllabics with an open second syllable. According to the proto-Saamic morpho-phonological rules, the stem consonant center exhibits the strong grade before an open second syllable, unlike the predicative forms which have a closed second syllable ending in {\it -s} and show the weak grade of the consonant center.

The same morpho-phonological rule applies to loan adjectives with ending-less attributive forms (like ‘small’ in Northern Saami: \textit{smávva} [small:\-\textsc{attr}] $\leftarrow$ \textit{smáves}). If one adopts the idea of \textit{-s} originally being a Germanic case suffix, the attributive forms of the loan adjectives in Saamic can only be derived from the strong-declension forms of Germanic predicative adjectives and not from attributive adjectives.

In the case of the inherited Saamic adjectives, however, it is usually assumed that the predicative ending \textit{-s} is derivational (see also the following paragraph). This assumption presupposes the ending-less (attributive) adjective being the base form from which the predicative form is derived by means of the derivational ending \textit{-s}. %But this would likewise fit the morpho-phonological rules with weak consonant stem grades in the attributive forms.

\paragraph{Locative adjective derivation} According to \citet[96]{bergsland1946}, the origin of the attributive suffix \textit{-s} in Saamic is identical with that of the synchronically homophone adjective derivational suffix \textit{-s} originating from a lative case marker. Cognate formatives deriving adjectives from nouns occur in other Uralic languages, like Hungarian \textit{erős} ‘powerful, strong’ ($\leftarrow$ \textit{erő} ‘power, strength’), \textit{kékes} ‘bluish’ ($\leftarrow$ \textit{kék} ‘blue’).

The development of local case expressions to adjectives is semantically plausible and could in principle be adopted for Saamic. Probably, the local case suffix was first used as adverbalizer of nominal stems and became a true adjectivizer at a later stage, hence:

\begin{exe}
\ex	\textsc{lative case} $\Rightarrow$ \textsc{adverbalizer} $\Rightarrow$ \textsc{adjectivizer}
\end{exe}
The intermediate stage in the assumed development from a local case expression to an adjective is reflected in place adverbs like Northern Saami \textit{guhkás} ‘(going) far’ $\Leftarrow$ proto-Saamic \textit{*kuhkā-se̮} \cite[246]{sammallahti1998b} and probably also in other adverbal derivations, like the collective numbers on \textit{-s}, cf.~Northern Saami \textit{golmmas} ‘a group of three’ $\leftarrow$ \textit{golbma} ‘three’.

Since predicative adjectives are not subject of this investigation, the the observation is sufficient that both the assumed (inherited) locative derivation and the assumed suffix borrowing are possible scenarios which do not necessarily exclude each other. As a result of these developments, a lexically defined subclass of adjectives with predicative forms on \textit{-s} arose in Common Saamic (or earlier). The marker of this class of adjectives, the ending \textit{-s}, is either:
\begin{itemize}
\item borrowed from < proto-North-Germanic \textit{-R} \textsc{m.nom.sg}
\item derived (historically) from $\Leftarrow$ \textsc{lative case}, %gib die Etymologie vom LATIVE
\item the result of merger of both developments.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The adjective class characterized by predicative forms on \textit{-s} (which has more or less regular ending-less attributive forms) is clearly identifiable in all modern Saamic languages.

Bergsland's (\citeyear[96]{bergsland1946}) suggestion that the similar ending \textit{-s} in the attributive forms of certain adjectives goes back to the Uralic lative case suffix as well is relevant to the present investigation. Deduced from his statement that the attributive suffix \textit{-s} is “originally a Finno-Volgaic lative suffix” Sammallahti (\citeyear[71]{sammallahti1998b}) agrees with Bergslands explanation. \cite{judakin1997} also argues in this direction.

The adjective ending \textit{-s}, which is the basis for Bergsland's and Sammallahti's argumentation, marks the predicative form of some adjectives and the attributive form of others. There are only a few adjectives which have the ending \textit{-s} in both predicative and attributive forms. Neither Bergsland nor Sammallahti discuss the question as to whether the assumed lative derivation originally occurred: a) on predicative adjectives, b) on attributive adjectives, or c) on both forms simultaneously.
 
A cross-comparison of cognate forms of attributive and predicative adjectives in different Saamic languages suggests that adjectives with similar predicative and attributive forms with \textit{-s} form a minor class which very likely arose as the result of a secondary development.

Cross-comparison can also provide evidence for separate etymologies of two homophone predicative and attributive endings \textit{-s}. The locative derivational suffix can only be the source of this suffix \textit{-s} which is homophone on predicative and attributive adjectives in modern West-Saamic languages. The original attributive adjective suffix, however, should be reconstructed as a (phonetically palatalized) suffix *[-sVʲ$_{[+front]}$] preceding a front vowel. In the Kola Saamic languages, the attributive suffix \textit{-s'} has a palatalized coda and is clearly distinct from the non-palatalized \textit{-s} on predicative adjectives as well as from the (cognate) lative adverbalizer \textit{-s}.

\paragraph{Attributive nominalization} A different hypothesis about the origin of the attributive forms in Saamic has been proposed by Joszéf Budenz (\citeyear{budenz1870}; according to \citealt{atanyi1942,atanyi1943}) who believed that the suffix \textit{-s} represents the original possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular. Budenz does not give any evidence specifically for Saami. He simply assumes that the determinative function of the possessive suffix, a similar use of which he observed in different Uralic and Turkic languages (cf.~also Section \ref{uralic-turkic diachr}), caused the development in Saami. Budenz' idea was taken up specifically for Saamic by Atányi (\citeyear{atanyi1942}, \citeyear{atanyi1943}). Atányi also refers to Nielsen (\citeyear{nielsen1933}, reprinted in \citealt{nielsen1945b}), who had a similar idea (probably independently of Budenz, who he does not refer to).

This hypothesis on the origin of the attributive forms in Saamic perfectly accounts for the different phonological shapes of the (historical) adjectivizer \mbox{\textit{*-s}} and the attributive suffix \textit{-s} ($\Rightarrow$ East-Saami \textit{-s'}). According to this theory, recently taken up again by \cite{riesler2006b}, the attributive suffix \textit{-s/-s'} reflects an old 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive suffix which was used as an attributive article on contrastive-emphasized adjectives.

The reconstructed proto-Saamic forms of the possessive marker \textit{*-sē} \cite[73]{sammallahti1998b} versus the adjectivizer \textit{*-se̮} are consistent with the synchronic findings. The different phonological form of the two suffixes (/-s\textsuperscript{j}/ versus /-s/) in the Kola Saamic languages and the phonological merger of both suffixes (non-palatalized /-s/) in the western Saamic languages can be accounted for by a regular sound law: In the Kola Saamic languages the apocope of etymologically front vowels (\textit{*i, *e}) is reflected by the palatalization of the consonant preceding the lost vowel. Apocope of non-front vowels (like \textit{*-se̮}) did not affect the quality of the consonant. This sound law does not apply to the western Saamic languages which do not exhibit (phonological) palatalization and consequently consonants preceding etymologically front and back vowels are non-palatalized.

Beside the overall irregularity in the attributive marking in all Saamic languages (Section \ref{saami synchr}), the different morpho-phonological behavior of the nominal stems which \textsc{poss:3sg} and \textsc{attr} attach to appears to be an argument against this reconstruction.

A noun marked for possession is in the strong consonant grade. An adjective marked for attribution is always in the weak grade. In the example above, the strong grade of the consonant (orthographically represented as \textit{hk} in Kildin Saami and \textit{hkk} in Northern Saami) occurs in the nominative case of the bare or possessive marked noun (\textit{suhk/\-suohkku, suhkes'/\-suohkkus}) as well as in the predicative form of the adjective (\textit{kuhk'/\-kuhkki}). The attributive form of the adjective (\textit{kugk'/\-guhkes}) and the noun stem hosting the locative suffix (\textit{sugkes't/\-suohkus}) are in the strong grade.

Historically, consonant gradation was a purely phonological process. The strong consonant grade occurred before the open final syllable of a disyllabic word. The stem consonant was phonetically shortened when the final open syllable was closed due to inflectional processes. Consonant gradation was later morphologized due to phonological attrition and the loss of certain inflectional suffixes.

From a synchronic point of view, the consonant gradation rules account for the weak consonant grade in the attributive form of the adjective but not for the strong grade in the noun with possessive marking. The Northern Saami words \textit{suohkku} ‘stocking’ and \textit{guhkki} ‘long (pred.)’ have open second syllables hence strong consonant stems (here a consonant cluster, the first part of which is a geminate /\=CC/). The second syllable in both forms is closed: \textit{suohkkus} /suoh:.ku-s/ marked with the possessive suffix and \textit{guhkis} /kuh.ki-s/ marked with the attributive suffix. However, the consonant stem of the noun \textit{suohkkus} remains strong (/\=CC/) even before the syllable closing suffix, whereas the gemi\-nate part of the cluster is shortened (/CC/) in the adjective \textit{guhkis}.

It is important to note that the possessive suffix is reconstructed as proto-Saamic \textit{*-sē} \cite[73]{sammallahti1998b} and thus originally had a different syllable structure. The formative obviously did not close the second syllable in proto-Saamic, as in /**kuh:.ke.-sē/ and /**suoh:.ku.-sē/.\footnote{Note that these invented examples in simplified transcriptions serve the purpose of illustration (and are hence marked with **). The stem of the adjective ‘long’ is reconstructed as proto-Saamic \textit{*ku\`{h}kē} \cite[246]{sammallahti1998b}. The noun ‘stocking’ is a loan word (cf.~Swedish dial. \textit{sokk}, Finnish \textit{sukka}) and might not be reconstructable for proto-Saamic.} From a diachronic point of view, the consonant gradation rules would thus account for the strong consonant grade in the noun marked with a possessive suffix but not for the weak grade in the attributive adjective.
 
Two possible explanations could explain the different consonant grades in the noun and the adjective marked by means of \textit{-s} $\Leftarrow$ \textit{*-sē}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Following Nielsen (\citeyear{nielsen1945b}), the possessive marker in its function as attributive nominalizer was originally attached to a genitive (i.e.~weak stem) form of the adjective. The weak consonant stem was thus triggered by the genitive suffix, reconstructed as pre-proto-Saamic \textit{*-n} $\Rightarrow$ proto-Saamic \mbox{\textit{*-Ø}} \cite[65]{sammallahti1998b} and preceding the attributive marker. The date of the morphologization of stem gradation would not be relevant for this explanation.
\item The other possible explanation presupposes a relatively late date for the morphologization of stem gradation, i.e.~not earlier than the apocope of the possessive marker's final vowel (\textit{-s $\Leftarrow$ *-sē}). If the possessive marker was not a true suffix but a phonological word on its own by the time stem gradation was morphologized in Saamic, the marker would have remained outside the phonological domains of its host word and would not have been able to trigger stem gradation on the latter. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Since genitive (or “possessor case”) marking on attributive adjectives is attested in other northern Eurasian languages, as in both Yukagir languages (cf.~Section \ref{yukagir synchr}) and in Lezgian (cf.~Section \ref{lezgian synchr}), Nielsen's assumption that the 3\textsuperscript{rd} singular possessive marker was originally attached to an attributive form of adjectives (or other nominals) in genitive is principally possible. 

Yet there is no evidence that genitive attribution marking on adjectives ever occurred regularly in Saamic or even in other Uralic languages.\footnote{The “defective” agreement paradigm of pronouns (and even sometimes adjectives) with the genitive singular form in all cases except nominative singular can scarcely be connected to Nielsen's idea. As an anti-construct state marker, the “genitive” should occur through the whole paradigm including in nominative singular.} Furthermore, the functional side of the assumed development, in which an adjective marked by two attributive markers (genitive+attributive nominalizer) simultaneously, would also need some further clarification.

The second hypothesis assuming that the possessive marker never triggered stem gradation, could also account for the weak consonant grade in adjectives (remember that the weak grade seemed to contradict the stem gradation rules from a historical point of view). In certain aspects, the possessive marker behaves like a free pronoun rather than like an affix: The possessive marker shows pronominal agreement (and hosts the agreement suffixes which co-reference the number of the possessor) but the marker itself is hosted by an inflected noun (marked for number and case of the possessed). Note also that the possessive inflection is morpho-syntactically different from case and number inflection in the closely related Finnic languages. Only the latter features trigger noun phrase internal agreement.

Only the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular possessive marker was used as an attributive nominalizer. Since this marker was hosted by uninflected adjectives, it is reasonable to assume that at one point the nominalizing possessive marker behaved differently from true possessive markers. The attributive nominalizer might thus have become a true phonologically bound formative earlier than the homophone possessive marker. As a result of the apocope of the suffix-final vowel, the second syllable in the attributive form was closed:
\begin{exe}
\ex 
\gll	/**kuh:.ke.-sē/ $\Rightarrow$ /**kuh.ke-s/\\
	long-\textsc{poss:3sg} {} long-\textsc{attr}\\
\end{exe}
Subsequently, the stem gradation rules were applied regularly and yeilded the short consonant grade of the adjective stem equipped with the affixal article. The noun equipped with the possessive marker, however, kept its open second syllable even after the apocope. The non-affixal possessive suffix – as a phonological word of its own – remained outside the phonological domain of stem gradation.
\begin{exe}
\ex 
\gll	/**suoh:.ku.=sē/ $\Rightarrow$ /**suoh:.ku.=s/\\
	stocking=\textsc{poss:3sg} {} stocking=\textsc{poss:3sg}\\
\end{exe}

\subsection{The origin of anti-construct state marking in Saamic}

Synchronic data from related Uralic languages provide good evidence in favor of the assumed grammaticalization path from possessive to anti-construct state marking in Saami. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{possessive(3sg)} $\Rightarrow$ \textsc{attributive nominalization} $\Rightarrow$ \textsc{anti}-\textsc{construct}
\end{exe}
The first step of this development, i.e.~the use of the possessive marker as an attributive article, is attested in the Permic languages Komi and Udmurt. Note also that the possessive marker in Udmurt shows different morphological behavior depending on its function as a true possessive or as an attributive article. For more detail see the respective sections on the synchrony (\ref{udmurt synchr}) and diachrony (\ref{udmurt diachr}) of attribution marking in Udmurt.

The Permic languages are closely related to Saamic and, theoretically, the rise of attributive marking in these two branches of Uralic could go back to a common proto-Uralic construction. True evidence to prove such a common development at a relatively early time is, however, missing. Quite the contrary, it could be objected that the innovation of a new type of attribution marking is currently under way in the Permic languages whereas the innovation in Saamic took place 2000 years ago and is obviously loosing ground today in favor of the re-introduced type juxtaposition.

But the comparison with the related Permic languages makes sense from a purely typological perspective. Assuming that the possessive marker already had a “determinative” function in proto-Uralic (as stated, e.g., by \citealt[32]{janhunen1981}; \citealt[66, 81]{decsy1990}; \citealt{kunnap2004}) and that this function is still present in most of the modern Uralic languages, the existence of an attributive nominalizer in Permic indisputably proves that the proposed origin of the attribution marker in Saamic is functionally plausible.

Furthermore, the nominalizing function of the (person-deictic) possessive marker is attested not only in several Uralic languages but also in Turkic languages. And, finally, a typologically similar development of a (local-deictic) demonstrative to an attributive article is also attested in Indoeuropean languages of the area.

In all mentioned Turkic, Uralic and Indoeuropean languages where the development of attributive nominalizers is attested, this innovative type of attribution marking originally co-occurred with another, inherited type. The use of contrastive pairs of attributes marked with or without the anti-construct state marker in modern Saamic languages provides good evidence for a similar development in earlier stages of Saami.

Several grammatical descriptions of Northern Saami give examples of such contrastive pairs of attributes with different meanings. Nielsen describes the difference between forms with and forms without an attributive suffix as a difference in “modality” of the attributive relation \cite[203]{nielsen1945b}. Most examples, however, do not display true adjectives but rather attributive forms of present participles. If the property denoted by the participle is stressed or emphasized as belonging permanently to the referent of the modified noun the participles are often equipped with the attributive suffix.

\glt	‘wet weather (i.e.~weather full of rain)’
\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
It must be emphasized that these adjectives equipped with the attributive suffix are additionally marked as denoting permanent or “definite” properties. This is exactly consistant with the reconstructed meaning of the so-called weak adjective forms in proto-Germanic or the so-called long adjective forms in proto-Baltic and proto-Sla\-vic (cf.~Section \ref{slavic diachr}). The semantics of the regular and productive contrastive-focus constructions in Chuvash and Udmurt (which are often described as “emphatic” or “definite” as well; cf.~Sections \ref{chuvash synchr} and \ref{udmurt synchr}) also show a perfect parallel to Saamic. 

It is thus most likely that the Saamic anti-construct state marker originates from a construction in which the possessive marker 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular was used as attributive nominalizer in apposed noun phrases similar to the contras\-tive-focus construction attested in Modern Udmurt and in several other Uralic and non-Uralic languages of northern Eurasia.

Whereas the unmarked noun phrase type in proto-Saamic was characterized by juxtaposition, the attributive article was used to mark a construction with a contrastive-focused adjective. The emphatic construction later became generalized as the default marker of the attributive connection.\footnote{The zero-morpheme (equipped with the nominalizer Ø-\textsc{nmlz}) in (\ref{saami gram}) and following examples is only presented for a better illustration of the empty head position to which the (nominalized) adjective moves in the appositive noun phrase.}

\end{exe}
The irregularities in the use of attributive forms within and across the modern Saamic languages are the result of recent developments. Originally, the attributive form was generated regularly and productively. A cross-comparison of adjectives in different Saamic languages clearly shows that adjectives with deleted \textit{-s/-s'} in one Saamic language exhibit the suffix in another language. Consider, for example, Northern Saami \textit{uhca} but Lule Saami \textit{ucces} ‘small’ or Northern Saami \textit{seakka} but Kildin Saami \textit{sie{\ng}{\ng}kes'} ‘thin’ (for more examples see \citealt{riesler2006b}).

It is most likely that neither the predicative forms (ending in \textit{-d} or \textit{-s}) nor the attributive form (ending in \textit{-s/-s'}) reflect inherited stems in Saami. Both are complex forms which are derived from either nominal or verbal stems by means of different suffixes. The predicative forms with \textit{-s} evolved from derivations by means of an old lative case suffix. Germanic loan adjectives with the homophone (Germanic) ending \textit{-s} ($\Leftarrow$ proto-Germanic \textit{-R}) where integrated into the class of these predicative “lative-derivations”. The attributive suffix \textit{-s/-s'}, on the other hand, originates from the possessive marker 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular which was originally used as an attributive nominalizer (i.e.~attributive article) in contrastive-focus constructions. The suffix was later generalized as the default attributive state marker.

The merger of predicative and attributive forms of some adjectives observed in modern Saamic languages does not contradict the proposed reconstruction of the original attributive marking. It does, however, reflect another diachronic path of adjective attribution marking: namely the collapsing of an originally regular and productive construction and the innovation of a new type. Interestingly, this secondary development in modern stages of Saamic will most likely result in the renewed introduction of juxtaposition, i.e.~the original Uralic prototype of adjective attribution marking.

\section[Agreement in Finnic]{The emergence of agreement in Finnic} \label{Finnic diachr}

The languages of the Finnic branch spoken in the northwestern periphery of Uralic are exceptional within this family because they exhibit head-driven agreement as the default type of attribution marking of adjectives.

\end{exe}
%Note, however, that not all morphological features assign their values to the attributive adjective in Finnish. Whereas number (\ref{fin num}) and case marking (\ref{fin case}) is assigned to the adjective, possessive marking (\ref{fin poss}) is not.
%\footnote{\cite[212]{mark1979} mentions also the missing agreement category \textsc{possessive} in Finnish (as in the other Finnic languages) Finnish \textit{sininen kukka-ni} [blue flower-\textsc{poss:1sg}] ‘my blue flower'. believes that the possessive declension of nouns is younger than the agreement of adjectives}
There is no doubt that agreement marking replaced juxtaposition at a certain point during the linguistic development from proto-Uralic to proto-Finnic.

In several Uralic languages, irregular agreement of pronominal modifiers and even some adjectives and adjective-like modifiers are attested (cf.~examples in \citealt{honti1997}). This might indicate a connection to the fully developed agreement marking of adjectives in Finnic. It is, however, unclear whether the incomplete and irregular agreement phenomena in Saamic and other closely related Uralic languages reflect a stage of development at which agreement marking was more widespread – in at least the Finnic and Saamic branches – or agreement marking is due to a more recent innovation which became completely enforced only in the Finnic branch. 

The rise of agreement marking on attributive adjectives, pronouns, and numerals in Finnic is usually regarded as a result of language contact with Indoeuropean languages from the Germanic and/or Baltic groups (cf.~\citealt[25]{tauli1955}; \citealt{hajdu1996}). Indeed, the high amount of Germanic and Baltic loanwords in Finnic languages indicate intimate contacts between speakers of Uralic and Indoeuropean languages in that area. In order to prove the hypothesis that agreement marking arose as a result of influence from Indoeuropean languages, however, one has to reconstruct  concrete mechanisms behind this profound contact-induced language change. The idea that agreement marking is a borrowed model might not be as straightforward as it appears. Even though many Uralic languages under strong Russian influence seem to have borrowed many more grammatical features than Finnic did under Germanic and Baltic influence, none of these languages shows any trace of borrowed Russian agreement marking.

In a short article, \citet{mark1979} presents a contact-independent explanation of the innovative head-driven agreement marking in Finnic. His explanation is based on the observation that nominalized adjectives in apposition to nouns in Hungarian (as well as in other Uralic languages) show agreement triggered by the semantic head of the elliptic noun phrase.
\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Hungarian} \citep[209]{mark1979} \label{hung ap}

\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Similar ideas about a possible contact-independent origin of head-driven agreement in Finnic have also been put forward by, e.g., \cite{ravila1941} or \cite{papp1962}. In theory, the rise of agreement marking as a result of generalization of an originally emphasized adjective in apposition seems plausible. Language contact with agreement-mar\-king languages could still have been a catalyst. 

In Hungarian, the attributive appositions described by Márk are post-positio\-ned while attributive adjectives in Finnish still precede the noun. A comparison to attributive apposition by means of nominalization in Udmurt seems more promising. In Section \ref{udmurt synchr} on the synchrony of attri\-butive marking in Udmurt, it has been demonstrated how case and number agreement marking occurs in the contrastive-focus construction with attributive adjectives and pronouns.

\end{xlist}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
In both Hungarian and Udmurt examples (\ref{hung ap}) and (\ref{udmurt ap}), the agreement morphology is syntactically spread from the (semantic) head noun to the adjectival modifier only in appositive noun phrases (with a contrastive-focused modifier). In Udmurt, there is an additional morpheme available, i.e.~the attributive nominalizer \textit{-(ė)z} ($\Leftarrow$ \textsc{poss:3sg}). In the Hungarian example, the emphasized construction is only marked by the duplicated number and case agreement (in combination with changed constituent order).

Attributive apposition in contrastive-focus constructions is without a doubt innovative in Udmurt. Since all members of the Permic group show similar constructions, the development could be dated back to proto-Permic and would thus have a time depth comparable to the innovation of head-driven agreement in Finnic. Since head-driven agreement is also involved in Udmurt anti-construct state marking (namely as a “relict” of the appositional structure in which the contrastive-focused attribute originally occurred), the Permic and Finnic innovations could be structural parallels. Modern Finnic languages, however, do not provide any evidence that an attributive nominalizer was ever used as a marker of appositive attribution. The agreement markings thus seems to be the primary innovation assumedly caused by contact with “agreeing” Indoeuropean languages. Regardless of contact influence being involved or not, the innovative head-driven agreement marking in Finnic could still have been used in an appositive construction originally. Note also that in Udmurt, number agreement sometimes (irregularly) occurs even in constructions without the contrastive-focus marker.
\begin{exe}
\ex Head-driven plural agreement in \textsc{Udmurt} \citep{winkler2001}
\gll	badǯ́ym-jos gurt-jos\\
	big-\textsc{pl} house-\textsc{pl}\\
\glt	‘LARGE houses’
\end{exe}
Note even that a similar innovation of head-driven agreement in contrastive-focus constructions is attested not only for Permic languages but also occurs irregularly in other Uralic branches (cf.~\citealt[136–138, 142]{honti1997} for Mari and Nenets; Florian Siegl (pc) for Enets).

To conclude these tentative considerations, it cannot be ruled out that the rise of head-driven agreement marking in Finnic and anti-construct state agreement in Udmurt are both results of original attributive apposition constructions. For Finnic, however, this idea remains highly speculative unless one can find evidence for the occurrence of an attributive nominalizer such as the marker in Modern Udmurt or in proto-Saamic. 

Whereas anti-construct state agreement marking in Udmurt (and other Permic languages) only substitutes for the default marker in contrastive-focused constructions, Finnic and Saamic have completely lost Uralic juxtaposition as the default adjective attribution marking device and innovated completely new mor\-pho-syntactic devices. It must also be noted that the Finnic and Saamic innovations took place in two closely related and geographically adjacent bran\-ches of Uralic. Moreover, the developments are of similar age. And finally, non-related but geographically adjacent languages (Baltic, Germanic, Sla\-vic) show structurally similar developments.

\section{Other attested scenarios}
The previous sections dealt with the rise of adjective attribution marking devices in a few branches of Indoeuropean, Uralic and Turkic. The synchronic data from the synchronic survey in Part \ref{part synchr}, however, present evidence of several diachronic scenarios. Only a few of them will be sketched in the following sections.

\subsection[Articles, definiteness and adjective attribution]{Articles, definiteness and the evolution of adjective attribution marking in Indoeuropean}
The rise of attributive articles and their (partial or complete) further development to definite markers in Baltic, Slavic and Germanic, as described above, took place  on functionally and chronologically parallel paths in various other Indoeuropean languages of Europe. This has been observed by several scholars (cf.~\citealt{brugmann-etal1916}; \citealt{gamillscheg1937}; \citealt{heinrichs1954} and, more recently, \citealt{nocentini1996}, \citealt{philippi1997}; \citealt{himmelmann1997}). It is not clear whether these parallel developments across western-Indoeuropean branches can be explained in terms of areal typology, i.e.~as the result of linguistic contacts, or whether they are inherited from a common ancestor language. Independent developments, though theoretically possible, seem rather unlikely given the close genealogical and areal connection between the languages in question.

In those western Indoeuropean branches where definite markers have evol\-ved, cognate formatives are also usually attested as adjective attribution markers. The attributive article in Rumanian, for instance, (Section \ref{rumanian synchr}) is also attested in Latin and other Romance languages, cf.~Latin {\it Cato ille maior, Babylon illa magna}.\footnote{Cf.~the secondary attributive articles in Germanic languages in similar constructions: English {\it Philip the Fair}, German {\it Friedrich der Große} which is also cognate (and homophone) with the definite marker. The Germanic constructions have been dealt with in more detail in Section \ref{attr nmlz}.} The suffixed definite marker in Rumanian evolved from this attributive article (\citealt{gamillscheg1937}; \citealt[5]{nocentini1996}). Note also that the attributive article in Romance is polyfunctional and can mark adjectival, genitival and prepositional attributes as well as relative clauses.

In the two Albanian languages (cf.~Section \ref{albanian synchr}), the attributive article {\it i} {\sc nom}, {\it e/të} {\sc acc} and {\it të} {\sc obl} and the definite suffix {\it -i} {\sc nom}, {\it -in/-në} {\sc acc} and {\it it} {\sc obl} most likely have the same etymological source, i.e.~Indoeuropean *{\it -to} (cf.~\citet[165]{himmelmann1997} with references), which is also the etymological source of the definite marker \textit{to} and the homophone attributive article in Ancient Greek (cf.~Section \ref{greek synchr} for the respective constructions in Modern Greek).

Indoeuropean *{\it -to} is the etymological source of secondary attributive articles in Sla\-vic languages as well. The use of this marker in attributive apposition constructions is already well-attested in Old East-Sla\-vic documents.

In Bulgarian, the former attributive nominalizer grammaticalized into a true definite marker. In an analogous manner (but much later in time), reflexes of the proto-Sla\-vic pronoun \textit{*tъ} \textsc{m} developed into definite suffixes in northern Russian dialects (cf.~\citealt
{leinonen2006a}).\footnote{Whereas Komi-Zyrian (Uralic) influence triggered the suffixation of these anaphoric markers in northern Russian dialects \citep
{leinonen2006a}, a typologically similar grammaticalization process due to Turkic influence is behind the chronologically much older suffixation of definite marking in Bulgarian \citep[114–122]{kusmenko2008}.}

Dahl (\citeyear[149–152]{dahl2003}; see also \citealt[115]{dahl2007}) shows that in some languages definite noun phrases with attributive adjectives (or other modifiers) show special behavior. He compares the “displaced”\footnote{The term “displaced” is not used by Dahl but adopted from \citet[114–116]{melcuk2006}.} definite marking with “long form” adjectives in the Baltic languages with, among others, the demonstrative \textit{ille} linking postponed adjectives to proper nouns in Latin constructions like \textit{Babylon illa magna} \cite[150]{dahl2003}. But due to its function and syntactic behavior the attributive article in Romance can clearly be distinguished from definite markers \citep[329]{gamillscheg1937}. As it was demonstrated for the Baltic languages (Section~\ref{anti-constr agr}), the so-called “long form” inflection (i.e.~anti-construct state agreement inflection) of adjectives is not a true definiteness marker.

Dahl also gives examples of languages in which “displaced” definiteness markers (or “quasi-definiteness markers”) evolved from other sources than local-deictic pronouns, as in Amharic where an attributive nominalizer grammaticalized from a (person-deictic) possessive marker in contrastive-focus construction.

The suffix {\it -u} ({\sc m}) used for emphasizing the adjective is homophone with the definite noun marker and with the 3\textsuperscript{rd} singular possessive marker. Note that the possessive and the definite suffixes of nouns (or noun phrases) are mutually exclusive \citep[463]{hudson1997}. Hence, the examples in (\ref{amharic ambiguous}) are ambiguous; they could have a possessive or a definite reading. The “emphasizing” adjective suffix {\it -u} ({\sc m}), however, does not co-occur with the definite suffix. Therefore, the reading of the examples in (\ref{amharic nonambiguous}) is not ambiguous.

Consequently, the suffix {\it -u} ({\sc m}) in Amharic should be analyzed as an adjective attribution marker rather than as a “detached” marker of definiteness.

Contrastive-focus marking on adjectives in Amharic is thus very similar to the marking found in Udmurt. In both languages, attributive apposition is marked by means of attributive nominalization. The respective formatives in both languages originate from (person-deictic) possessor markers.

Consistently, data from northern Eurasian languages and Amharic do not provide evidence for the existence of “displaced” definiteness markers. From a diachronic perspective, however, there is much evidence for a functional overlapping between attributive nominalization and definiteness marking. In all Indoeuropean languages dealt with so far, adjective attribution is the primary function. The former local-deictic marker in these languages always grammaticalizes into an attributive nominalizer first. The further development into true markers of definiteness comes only after this stage.

\subsection[Head-marking attributive construct state]{The emergence of head-marking attributive construct state in Iranian}\label{iranian diachr}
As shown in Section \ref{iranian synchr} of Part \ref{part synchr}, several Iranian languages of the northern Eurasian area exhibit a head-marking attributive construct state device as a licenser of adjective attribution. The Iranian construct state marker (aka \textit{Ezafe}) originates from the Old Iranian relative particle \textit{-hya}, which has undergone a process of grammaticali\-zation, to end up as a part of nominal morphology in the modern Iranian languages \citep{haider-etal1984,samvelian2007b}. Since the Old Persian relative particle \textit{-hya} itself originates from a demonstrative, the emergence of construct state marking in Iranian and anti-construct state marking in other Indoeuropean languages follow a similar path. Originally, \textit{-hya} was a grammatical word marking the phrase or clause on its right as a syntactic modifier of the noun on its left \citep{haider-etal1984}. Syntactically, the marker was an attributive article hosted by the attribute. In Baltic and Sla\-vic, the article developed further into an anti-construct state agreement marker (Section~\ref{slavic diachr}). In Iranian, however, the article attached phonologically to the head noun. According to \citet[3]{samvelian2007} this conflict between opposite directions of phonological and syntactic alignments was later resolved by the reanalysis of the article as a head-marking inflectional affix. As the result of this grammaticalization, syntactic and phonological attachments were alined to each other.

\subsection[Innovation of juxtaposition]{Innovation of juxtaposition}
\paragraph{Loss of agreement marking}
Common Kartvelian can be reconstructed as a language exhibiting head-driven agree\-ment (in number and case) of adjectival modifiers following the head noun. In Old Georgian, this pattern is more or less preserved. In modern Kartvelian languages, however, the unmarked word order of adjectival modifiers and head is noun-final, although the opposite order is possible as well \cite[56]{harris1991a}. As shown in Section \ref{kartvelian synchr} of Part \ref{part synchr}, the agreement features of Common Kartvelian are more or less preserved only in the marked (but inherited) head-initial noun phrase type. In the head-final noun phrase type, on the other hand, modern Kartvelian languages display a strong tendency to lose head-driven agreement. Preposed attributive adjectives in Mingrelian and Laz are juxtaposed to the head noun as a rule. In Modern Georgian and Svan, the agreement paradigm of preposed attributive adjectives shows a high degree of syncretism (cf.~\citealt[56]{harris1991a}; \citealt[56–60, elsewhere]{tuite1998}).

Note that juxtaposition can also be innovated without constituent order shift, as in English where the change is a result of the complete loss of the agreement inflection during the course of time from Middle to Modern English. 

\paragraph{Loss of anti-construct marking}
Saamic languages (Section \ref{saamic diachr}) also present evidence of a language change in which juxtaposition replaces an original morpho-syntactic device. As already mentioned, the original anti-construct state marking (which was itself innovative in proto-Saamic) is in dissolution in modern Saamic languages as the result of the merger of attributive and predicative adjective forms which were originally distinguished from one another.

\section{Diachronic polyfunctionality}
In Chapter \ref{polyfunctionality}, a few examples of polyfunctional adjective attribution marking devices were presented. It was shown, however, that the polyfunctionality parameter is less relevant to northern Eurasian languages because most languages of the area exhibit highly differentiated attribution marking devices. Polyfunctionality might, however, indicate a historical dimension if additional semantics of attribution marking devices is taken into consideration and if the languages of a whole genera are compared to each other. For instance, construct state marking of adjectives and other modifiers, as attested especially in Indoeuropean varieties (but also in Turkic and Uralic), seems to be inherently tied to the evolution of attributive nominalization, contrastive focus and even definiteness marking in several languages. Figure \ref{ie-ural funcmap} shows functional maps similar to the one in Figures \ref{multi abcd} and \ref{lahu funcmap} in Chapter \ref{polyfunctionality} but with scope over cognate markers in whole language families.

\caption[Functional map of cognate devices]{Functional map of markers cognate with the Old Iranian “relative particle” \textit{-hya} (across Indoeuropean languages) and the possessive suffixes 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular (across Uralic, Turkic and Tungusic languages)}

The polyfunctionality of the Persian Ezafe {\it -(y)e} was described in Chapter \ref{polyfunctionality}. This construct state marker licenses nominal ({\sc attr}$_{N}$), adjectival ({\sc attr}$_{A}$) and adpositional ({\sc attr}$_{AdP}$) attributes as well as modification within an adpositional phrase ({\sc mod}$_{NP}$). The cognate formative in the closely related Iranian language Kurmanji is even connected to definiteness marking ({\sc def}) (\citealt{schroder2002}; cf.~also Table \ref{ez kirmanji paradigm} on page \ref{ez kirmanji paradigm}). In Old Iranian, Old Baltic and Old Slavic, a cognate marker was used as an attributive nominalizer ({\sc nmlz}, or as a “relative particle” marking non-verbal attributes; cf.~above Section \ref{iranian diachr} and \ref{slavic diachr}). The marker's further grammaticalization into an anti-construct state agreement marker in Baltic and Slavic is connected to contrastive-focus marking ({\sc contr}).

The marker described in the functional map for Uralic is the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular, which is used as a “quasi-definite marker” ({\sc def}) in a variety of modern Uralic languages. In Udmurt the original possessive suffix is regularly used as a nominalizer ({\sc nmlz}) and has grammaticalized into a marker of contrastive-focus of adjectives ({\sc contr}) (cf.~Section \ref{udmurt diachr}). In Saamic, finally, the cognate marker has grammaticalized into an anti-construct state marker ({\sc attr}$_{A}$).

Turkic is similar to Uralic but without evidence for the grammaticalization of the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular to a true adjective attribution marker. In Tungusic, finally, there is no evidence for definiteness marking but the possessive suffix 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular is used as dependent-driven agreement marker in Even ({\sc attr}$_{A}$).

These diachronic functional maps demonstrate general synchronic paths of attribution marking devices and give the impression that nominalization and appositive attribution play an important role in the further development of the respective markers as attribution marking devices.
