\chapter{Clause combinations}
\hypertarget{RefHeading22901935131865}{}
Some linguistic models, the mainstream generative grammar in particular, disregard the distinction between a clause and a sentence, but here the distinction is maintained. One of the main reasons is the medial clause system in Mauwake.  A simple sentence consists of one clause, but if that is a verbal clause, it must be a finite clause, not a medial one; medial clauses only function within a sentence in combination with other clauses. Their distribution is restricted to non-final position in a sentence -- they may occur sentence-finally only if they are dislocated. Medial clauses also add the chaining structure to the clause combination possibilities (\sectref{sec:8.2}), besides regular coordination (\sectref{sec:8.1}) and subordination (\sectref{sec:8.3}). 

A sentence consists of one or more clauses. The end of a sentence is marked in speech by a falling intonation, or by a slightly rising intonation in polar questions, and normally a pause. The sentence-final falling intonation is very clear, and can be distinguished from a less noticeable fall at the end of a non-final finite clause. In writing the end of a sentence is marked by a full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark.

A simple sentence is the same as a clause, and was discussed in Chapter 5.

When two main clauses are joined in a coordinate sentence, they are independent of each other as to their functional sentence type. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the first clause is declarative and the second one interrogative; in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the first clause is imperative and the second one declarative, but the order could also be reverse.

`(You) go to dance, I don't want to.'

In clause chaining (\sectref{sec:8.2}) and in complex clauses involving main and subordinate clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3}) the situation is more complicated. Formally almost all of the subordinate and medial clauses are neutral/declarative. A subordinate clause typically lacks an illocutionary force of its own \citep[32]{Cristofaro2003} and conforms to the functional sentence type of the main clause. In the following examples the subordinate clauses are in brackets.

The non-polar questions are an exception, since the question word may also be in a subordinate clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). When a subordinate clause contains a question word, the illocutionary force of a question spreads to whole sentence.

`You are telling me to go where?'

A medial clause is coordinate with the main clause but dependent on it (\sectref{sec:8.2}). The imperative form is only possible in finite verbs, and the polar question marker only occurs sentence-finally.\footnote{As an alternative marker the QM is used in non-final clauses as well (\sectref{sec:3.1.2.8}, 8.1.2).} Because of these formal restrictions it is impossible to have an imperative or interrogative medial clause coordinated with a declarative main clause. A medial clause commonly conforms to the illocutionary force of the final clause, but it does not need to do so. In the examples (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the bracketed medial clause is questioned with the main clause, in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) it is not.

When a medial clause itself contains a question word, the illocutionary force spreads to the whole sentence. 

\ea%x1363
\label{ex:x1363}

When the final clause is in the imperative mood, the implication of a command often extends backwards to a medial verb marked for the same subject (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but not so easily to one marked for a different subject. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) above the command /request extends to the medial clause, whereas in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) it does not. For more examples, see (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx})-(\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) above.

`(If/when) they shoot you, (then) say like that.'

Although it is impossible to have an imperative verb form in a medial clause, a ``soft'' command/request (\sectref{sec:7.3}) may be used in medial clauses, as it takes the medial verb form. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the first clause is a request, the second one a statement.

\section{Coordination of clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading22921935131865}{}
Coordination links units of ``equivalent syntactic status'' \citep[93]{Crystal1997}. Clausal coordination commonly refers to the coordination of main clauses, as that is much more frequent than the coordination of subordinate clauses. In the following, too, it is assumed that the discussion is about main clause coordination unless stated otherwise.

The main clauses joined by coordination are independent in the sense that they could stand alone as individual sentences. And the examples (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) above show that they can even manifest different functional sentence types. But they are called clauses 1) because they are coordinated within one sentence and 2) for the sake of consistency, since the coordinated medial (\sectref{sec:8.2.1}) and subordinate clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.6.1}) could not be called sentences.

As Giv\'on (1990:848) points out, no clause in a text is truly independent from its context. Likewise, the coordination vs. subordination of clauses is in many languages a matter of degree rather than a clear-cut distinction. 

Although chaining medial and final clauses (\sectref{sec:8.2}) is the main strategy for combining clauses in Mauwake, coordination of main clauses is also common. It is used not only for the cross-linguistically typical cases of conjunction, disjunction and adversative relations between clauses, but also for causal and consecutive relations.  

\subsection{Conjunction}
\hypertarget{RefHeading22941935131865}{}
Conjunction is the most neutral form of coordination: two or more clauses are joined in a sentence, with or without a link between them. If there is a link, it is a pragmatic additive that does not specify the semantic relationship between the clauses. This sometimes allows different interpretations for the relationship, but usually the context constrains the interpretation considerably. 

\subsubsection[Juxtaposition]{Juxtaposition}
\hypertarget{RefHeading22961935131865}{}
In juxtaposition\footnote{Also called ``zero strategy'' by \citet[25]{Payne1985}.} two or more clauses are joined without any linking device at all. According to \citet[8]{Haspelmath2007} unwritten languages tend to lack their own coordinators and therefore use more juxtaposition and/or coordinators borrowed  from other, more prestigious languages. 

In Mauwake, juxtaposition is the most typical strategy for conjunction overall. Especially the coordination of verbless clauses is often symmetrical: the reversal of the conjuncts is possible without a change of meaning. 

\ea%x1367
\label{ex:x1367}
\gll Wi  Yaapan  emeria  weetak,  mua  manek=iw. \\
      \\
\glt
\z

3p.UNM  Japan  woman  no  man  big=LIM

`The Japanese didn't have any wives, (they were) just the men.'

\ea%x1390
\label{ex:x1390}
\gll Kuuten  wiawi  iperowa,  yo  auwa  kapa=ke. \\
      \\
\glt
\z

Kuuten  3s/p.father  firstborn  1s.UNM  1s/p.father  lastborn=CF

`Kuuten's father was the firstborn (son), my father was the lastborn.'

Also, when one of the conjuncts is a verbless clause and another is a verbal one, symmetrical conjunction is quite common:

\ea%x1391
\label{ex:x1391}
\gll I  uruwa  miim-i-mik,  ni  sosora=ke. \\
      \\
\glt
\z

1p.UNM  loincloth  precede-Np-PR.1/3p  2p.UNM  grass.skirt=CF

`We father's side of the family (lit: loincloth) go first, you are mother's side (lit: grass skirt).'

Symmetrical conjunction of verbal clauses may be used, when there is parallelism between the clauses:

\ea%x1368
\label{ex:x1368}
\gll Na-emi  wi  afa  ar-omak-e-mik,  \\
      \\
\glt
\z

say-SS.SIM  3p.UNM  flying.fox  become-DISTR/PL-PA-1/3p

osaiwa  ar-e-mik,  biri-birin-e-mik.

bird.of.paradise  become-PA-1/3p  RDP-fly-PA-1/3p

`Saying so, they became many flying foxes, they became birds of paradise, they flew (away).'

\ea%x1392
\label{ex:x1392}
\gll Aria  makera  miirifa  okaiwi  soo=pa  kaik-i-mik,  \\
      \\
\glt
\z

alright  cane  end  other.side  trap=LOC  tie-Np-PR.1/3p

okaiwi  pia  kaik-i-mik.

other.side  bamboo  tie-Np-PR.1/3p

`Alright we tie one end of the cane to the trap, the other to a (piece of) bamboo.'

In the following example the medial clause relates to both of the final clauses, not just to the first one:

\ea%x1851
\label{ex:x1851}
\gll Koora-pa  efa  uruf-am-ik-eya  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{ikiw}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{-}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{i}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{-}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{nen} \\

come-Np-FU.1s

`You see me from the house and/as I will go and come.'

When the coordination is not symmetrical, the clause in the second conjunct is an example or an explanation of the first clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or it follows the first one in a temporal sequence (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x1370
\label{ex:x1370}

`We'll visit my parents, let's see them in the village.'

place  dark-INCH-PA-3s  place  ten  count?-PA-3s

`The truck broke and while they were fixing the truck it became dark, (then) it was midnight.'

A fairly common structure is one where the first conjunct is not directly followed by another finite clause but by one or more medial clauses before the final clause:

\ea%x1371
\label{ex:x1371}
\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Ikemika}  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{kaik-ow(a)  mua  nain  nop-a-mik},  imen-ap  \\

tell-2/3p.DS  3s.UNM  precede-PA-3s

`They looked for the medical orderly, and when they found him and told him, he went ahead of them.'

Juxtaposition in itself is neutral and only shows that the two or more clauses are somehow connected with each other, but it can be used when propositions joined by it have different semantic relationships with each other.

\ea%x1404
\label{ex:x1404}
\gll Waaya  maneka  marew  pun,  mua  unowa  me  wia  \\

      \\
\glt
\z

2p.UNM  eel  this  not  eat-IMP.2p  spirit  man=CF

`Don't eat this eel, (because) it is a spirit man.'

\subsubsection[Conjunction with coordinating connectives]{Conjunction with coordinating connectives}
\hypertarget{RefHeading22981935131865}{}
Two of the three pragmatic connectives (\sectref{sec:3.11.1}) are used as clausal coordinators: the additive \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}  and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aria} `alright' which marks a break in the topic chain. \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{Ne} can be used in some of the contexts where mere juxtaposition is also used, but it is less frequent. If the second conjunct is an explanation or example of the first one, conjoining the clauses with \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} is not allowed. Example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is a case of symmetrical coordination; but if the order of the two conjuncts were reversed, the adverbial \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pun} `also', which has to be in the second conjunct, would not move to the first conjunct with the rest of the clause.

\ea%x1372
\label{ex:x1372}
\gll I  mua=ko  me  wia  furew-a-mik,  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{ne}  yiena  pun  \\

mukuna=ko  me  op-a-mik.

fire=NF  not  hold-PA-1/3p

`We didn't sense anyone there and we ourselves did not hold fire either.'

The following example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is syntactically neutral, but semantically it is interpreted as both temporal and consecutive sequence.

\ea%x1373
\label{ex:x1373}
\gll ...maa  wiar  fe-feef-omak-e-mik,  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{ne}  wi  \\

ikiw-e-mik ...

go-PA-1/3p

`{\dots} they\textsubscript{i} spilled their\textsubscript{j} food, and (so/then) they\textsubscript{j} went (away) {\dots}'

When there are more than two coordinated clauses in a sentence without any intervening medial clauses, it is common to have \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}  joining the last two clauses:

\ea%x1374
\label{ex:x1374}
\gll Mua  kuum-e-mik  nain  me  wia  kuuf-a-mik,  me  \\
      \\
\glt
\z

man  burn-PA-1/3p  that1  not  3p.ACC  see-PA-1/3p  not

3p.ACC  sense-PA-1/3p  ADD  not  3p.ACC  find-PA-1/3p

`We didn't see the men who burned it, we didn't sense them and we didn't find them.'

The connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}  is also used in sentences where an adversative interpretation can be applied.\footnote{Using Haspelmath's (2007:28) terms, \textit{ne} in the adversative function could be called an \textit{oppositive} coordinator, as the second coordinand does not cancel an expectation like it does in adversative clauses formed with either the demonstrative \textit{nain} or the topic marker -\textit{na} (\sectref{sec:8.3.4}).}  The example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) describes a couple that stayed in the village during the war and placed some of their belongings outside their house to show that there were people living in the village, while many others ran away into the rainforest. 

\ea%x1375

`We placed the pots, spears and bamboo water containers in line in front of the house, but many ran away.'

The connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aria} 'alright' may be used when there is a change of topic or an unexpected development within the sentence.

\ea%x1376
\label{ex:x1376}

`Long ago, the parents of a boy cooked food in the afternoon, (but) perhaps they did not put any food for him {\dots}'

It is also the default coordinator when a non-verbal constituent in two or more otherwise very similar conjuncts are contrasted, or emphasized, in coordinated clauses.

\ea%x1379

`Eema came and told us, and the bald man himself too came and told us.'

\subsection{Disjunction}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23001935131865}{}
The speech of the Mauwake people tends to be rather concrete in the sense that they do not speculate much on different abstract alternatives. So disjunction of clauses, although possible, is not common. Disjunction is marked by the connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{e} `or' placed between the conjuncts (\sectref{sec:3.11.2}). 

\ea%x1385
\label{ex:x1385}
\gll Nain=ke  napum-ar-i-mik  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{e}  um-i-mik,  mua  oko  \\

sickness-INCH-PA-3s  that1  foresee-PA-2s

`That is about people becoming sick or dying, you foresaw (in a dream) that some man became sick.'

Sometimes the question marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{i}  replaces the connective.

\ea%x1387
\label{ex:x1387}
\gll Aria  no  ikoka  mua  owawiya  irak-ep=\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{i}  kamenap  \\

2s/p.brother  Kululu  here-PA-3s  INTJ

`Alright, later when you fight with your husband or do something like that, do not come to me, your brother Kululu is right here.'

Alternative questions (\sectref{sec:6.3.2}) have the question marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{i} cliticized to the end of the clause at least in the first conjunct. Closed alternative questions leave the question mark out of the last conjunct.

\subsection{Adversative coordination}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23021935131865}{}
There is no adversative coordinator in Mauwake. It was mentioned above  (\sectref{sec:3.11.1}, 8.1.1.2) that the pragmatic additive connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}, which is semantically neutral, is possible also when there is a relationship between clauses that may be interpreted as contrastive. 

\ea%x1388
\label{ex:x1388}
\gll Iir  nain  Kedem  manek  akena  keker  op-a-k \\

\glt
\z

\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{ne}  Yoli  weetak.

ADD  Yoli  no

`That time Kedem was very scared but Yoli wasn't.'

There are two strategies that can be used when a strong adversative is needed. A `but'-protasis \citep[237]{Reesink1983b} may be marked by either the distal demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that', or the topic marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na} (\sectref{sec:8.3.4}), added to a finite clause. The adversative clauses with the demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} differ from the nominalized clauses functioning as complement clauses or relative clauses in the following respects. Intonationally \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} is the initial element in the second one of the contrasted clauses, rather than a final element in a subordinate clause, and it is often preceded by a short pause. The protasis may even be a separate sentence (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x1395
\label{ex:x1395}

that1  1s.UNM  not  flee-SS.SIM-be-PA-1s

`Bombs kept dropping in front of my house. But I didn't keep running away.'

The next two examples are structurally very similar to sentences with relative clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.1.2}). But here the demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} is part of the adversative clause and is preceded by a pause. 

\ea%x1389
\label{ex:x1389}

\ea%x1394

op-a-mik.

hold-PA-1/3p

`We walked there, but we did not hold/have any fire.'

Compare (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) with the relative clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), where the demonstrative functions as a relative marker and comes at the end of the clause. This is shown by the slightly rising intonation on \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsxiiptItalic{nain}, as well as a pause following it in spoken text:\footnote{This similarity creates a problem with written texts that do not have adequate punctuation. Sometimes either interpretation is acceptable.} 

\ea%x1396
\label{ex:x1396}
\gll I  nan  soomar-e-mik  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{nain},  i  mukuna=ko  me  \\

\glt
\z

1p.UNM  there  walk-PA-1/3p  that1  1p.UNM  fire=NF  not

op-a-mik.

hold-PA-1/3p

`We who walked there didn't hold/have any fire.' (Or: `When we walked there, we didn't hold/have any fire.')

The adversative sentences formed with the topic marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na} are complex rather than coordinate sentences (\sectref{sec:8.3.4}).

\subsection{Consecutive coordination}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23041935131865}{}
Within a sentence, clauses are typically connected by one of the syntactically neutral strategies, which leave the semantic relationship implied. Some sentences using juxtaposition (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), the pragmatic additive \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or clause chaining (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) can be interpreted as having a consecutive relationship between the clauses, although this does not show in the syntax. This section deals with the cases where the consecutive relationship is marked overtly.

Relationships of cause and effect, or reason and result,\footnote{Reason-result relationship presupposes the presence of reasoning in the process, cause-effect relationship does not.}  are central in the discussion of causal and consecutive clauses. It seems that currently Mauwake may be developing a distinction between cause and reason on one hand, and between effect and result on the other. But the tendency, if there, is not very strong (\sectref{sec:3.11.2}). 

Both the clauses in a sentence expressing a cause-effect or reason-result relationship are main clauses and are in a coordinate relationship with each other. It is common for the two clauses to form separate sentences rather than be within the same sentence. 

The tendency to present events in the same order that they occur, common to languages in general, is very strong in Papuan languages. Consequently, there is a strong preference to present a cause clause before an effect clause (Haiman 1980:409, Roberts 1987:59, Reesink 1987). In Mauwake consecutive coordination is the default, unmarked strategy for those sentences that express cause-effect or reason-result relationships overtly, because their structure follows this principle, whereas in causal coordination sentences the effect is stated before the cause. 

\ea%x1400

`Friend, it was you who pitied me and killed this iguana, therefore you roast and eat this iguana.' 

Effect and result clauses use \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naapeya/naeya} `therefore, (and) so' (\sectref{sec:3.11.2}) as their connective:

\ea%x1401

`You yourself do bad things like that too, therefore you too will be under accusation.'

\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{Naapeya} can also co-occur with the conjunctive coordinator \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}. 

\ea%x1403

`They were walking there in that place and came down, and so the guilt (for starting a forest fire) stuck to them.'

The use of \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naapeya} and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naeya} is both external and internal, i.e. they connect events in a situation and ideas in a text. The internal use of \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne naapeya} and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aria naapeya} is restricted to intersentential use. They refer to a longer stretch in the preceding text as their protasis.

\ea%x1407

`You do (bad) things like that. Therefore the talk that he already said about you is very accurate.'

\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{Neemi}  is a consecutive coordinator that almost exclusively conjoins full sentences rather than clauses within a sentence: (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is from translated text but considered natural. (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is repeated here as (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). \textit{Neemi} is an internal connective, only used in reasoning. It requires some point of similarity between the two conjuncts.

`Christ received a lot of pain, so we all too get (pain) like that.'

The connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naap nain} is used almost only inter-sententially (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). Between clauses in a sentence it is possible but rare (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

\ea%x1905
\label{ex:x1905}

\subsection{Causal coordination, ``afterthought reason''}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23061935131865}{}
The causal coordination is a very marked structure, which shows in the unusual ordering of the clauses: the causal clause follows rather than precedes the consequent clause. The causal clause in Mauwake begins with the connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{moram} `because' (\sectref{sec:3.1.1.2}), which is originally the interrogative word for `why'.  There are two possible origins for this untypical structure. It may be a recent calque on the Tok Pisin causal construction, which uses \textstyleForeignWords{bilong wanem} `why/because' as the connector and the same ordering of the two clauses. The ordering of the clauses shows that it may also have originated as an ``afterthought reason'',\footnote{The term suggested by Ger Reesink.} even though  currently it is used when the cause or reason is emphasized. 

\ea%x1417

`We saw Poh San and were relieved (lit: liver fell), because we had thought that (her) sickness hadn't healed yet (but it had).'

\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{Moram wia} is used almost exclusively between full sentences (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}); the example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is the only intra-sentential instance of \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{moram wia} in the data. I have not noticed any semantic difference caused by the addition of the negator.

Both a causative and a consecutive connective can co-occur in the same sentence. When that happens, the consecutive clause occurs twice: first without a connective and after the causal clause with a connective. This underlines the strong preference to keep the cause-effect (or reason-result) order.

\subsection{Apprehensive coordination}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23081935131865}{}
A less common clause type, that of apprehensive clauses \citep[61]{Roberts1987}, also called negative purpose clauses (Haiman 1980:444, Thompson and Longacre 1985:188), is perhaps more commonly subordinate than coordinate. But in Mauwake the apprehensive clauses are coordinated finite clauses, originally separate sentences (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). The apprehension clause is introduced by the indefinite \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{oko} `other' (\sectref{sec:3.5.3}), which has also developed the meaning `otherwise'.

\section{Clause chaining}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23101935131865}{}
Clause chaining is a typical feature in Papuan languages, and in the Trans-New Guinea languages in particular.\footnote{Wurm seems to consider clause chaining a genetic feature of the TNG languages (1982:36), but Haiman suggests that it is an areal feature (1980:xlvii). Roberts, with the largest data to date, suggests that there is a combination of both, but leaves the final decision open (1997:122).}  A sentence may consist of several medial clauses\footnote{The terms \textit{medial} and \textit{final} clauses are well established in Papuan linguistics. }   where the verbs have medial verb inflection (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.4}), and a final clause where the verb has ``normal'' finite inflection (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.3}). Clause chaining indicates either temporal sequence or simultaneity between adjacent clauses.

The division into just medial and final clauses is not adequate for describing the system. Haiman and Munro call the medial clauses\textit{} \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{marking clauses}} and the clauses following them \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{reference clauses}} (1983:xii).\footnote{\citet{Comrie1983} and \citet{Roberts1997} call them \textit{marked clauses} and \textit{controlling clauses}, respectively.} Marking clause is simply another name for a medial clause and will not be used here. But a reference clause may be medial or finite\footnote{I prefer the term \textit{finite} to \textit{final} clauses (and verbs), as it is the finiteness rather than the position in the sentence that is important in their relation with medial clauses. Subordinate clauses are the most typical \textit{non-final} finite clauses, and they may also have medial clauses preceding them and relating to them.} -- what is important is that both the temporal relationship of the medial verb, and the person reference, is stated in relation to the reference clause. When a reference clause for a preceding medial clause is also a medial clause, it again has its own reference clause following it.

The medial clauses linked by clause chaining are sometimes called \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{cosubordinate}} (Olson 1981, Foley and VanValin 1984:257)\footnote{This is cosubordination at the \textit{peripheral} level; verb serialization is cosubordination at core or nuclear level.} or \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{coordinate-}}\textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{dependent}} \citep[177]{Foley1986}, because they share features with both coordinate and subordinate clauses. Their relationship with each other and with the following finite clause is essentially coordinate,\footnote{\citet{Roberts1988a} brings several syntactic arguments to show that basically switch reference is indeed coordination rather than subordination. But he also argues for a separate subordinate switch reference in Amele and some other languages.} but the medial clauses are dependent on the finite clause both for their absolute tense, and, in the case of ``same subject'' forms, also for their person/number specification. 

Another term commonly used for the chained clauses, \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{switch-reference clauses}} (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR}),\footnote{Clause chaining and switch reference are two separate strategies, but in Papuan languages the two very often  go together \citep[104]{Roberts1997}.} is related to their other function as a reference-tracking device (Haiman and Munro 1983:ix). They typically indicate whether their topic/subject is the same as, or different from, the topic/subject of the following clause. This is discussed below in \sectref{sec:8.2.3}. In this grammar the two terms are used interchangeably, as in Mauwake the medial verbs not only indicate a temporal relationship but are used for reference tracking as well.

\subsection{Chained clauses as coordinate clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23121935131865}{}
It is widely accepted that the relationship of medial clauses to their reference clauses is basically coordinate, but with some special features and exceptions.\footnote{E.g. \citet[175,193]{Reesink1987}, Roberts (1988a:51, 1994:13).} In Mauwake medial clauses are subordinate only if subordinated with the topic/conditional marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na}; otherwise they are coordinate. 

Instead of giving background information like subordinate clauses do, medial clauses are predications that carry on the foreground story line. But they are also different from coordinate finite clauses. The similarities and differences are discussed in this section.

The pragmatic additives \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aria} (\sectref{sec:3.11.1}) can occur between a medial clause and its reference clause, as between normal coordinate clauses. This is uncommon, however.

Coordinated main clauses are free in regard to their mood and, related to that, their functional sentence type. The medial clauses do not have any marking for mood.  They usually conform to that of the finite clause, but this is a pragmatic matter, not a syntactic requirement. 

When either the medial clause or the finite clause is a question, the whole sentence is interrogative, even if the other clause is a statement. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the finite clause is a polar question, but the medial clause is not questioned. In the story that (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is taken from, the killing is not questioned, only the manner. But since a medial clause cannot take the question marker, the verb in the finite clause has to carry the marking.

In regard to the scope of negation the same-subject medial clauses differ from all other clauses.  Negative spreading (\sectref{sec:6.2.4}) in both directions is allowed only between \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} medial clauses and their reference clauses; even there it is not very common. Especially backwards spreading is rare. In the following examples, negative spreading takes place in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but not in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). Between other types of clauses negative spreading is not permitted at all.

Like coordinated main clauses and unlike subordinate clauses, medial clauses are not embedded as constituents in other clauses. However, a medial clause may interrupt its reference clause and appear inside it, if the subject or object \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} of the reference clause is fronted as the theme and thus precedes the interrupting medial clause. For more examples, see (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). In the following examples the reference clause is bolded and the intervening medial clause is placed within square brackets.

\ea%x1464

3s.UNM  bow  man=LOC  be-SS

`Alright, the war was getting close and they dismissed my husband and he came to the village, after he had been a soldier.'

In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) both the object and the subject are fronted. After the first medial clause the object of the finite clause is fronted as the theme of the remainder of the sentence, and it pulls with it the subject, marked with the contrastive focus marker.  In the free translation passive is used, because the object is fronted as a theme.

The following three examples show that some of the same-subject medial clauses interrupting the reference clause, especially those that have a directional verb or the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aaw}- `take, get', may be in the process of grammaticalizing into serial verbs:

Right-dislocation of a medial clause is not unusual. One common reason for right-dislocations is an afterthought: the speaker notices something that should be part of the sentence and adds it to the end. Another reason is giving prominence to the dislocated clause, since the end of a sentence is a focal position. Especially the right-dislocation of same-subject sequential medial clauses breaks the iconicity between the events and the sentence structure, and has this effect. Consequently the right-dislocated \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} sequential clauses, like the ones in examples (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), are much more prominent than medial clauses in their normal position.

\subsection{Temporal relations in chained clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23141935131865}{}
Clause chaining in Mauwake distinguishes between sequential and simultaneous actions in the clauses joined by chaining, but only when the clauses have the same subject (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.5.1}). The sequential action verb (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) indicates that one action is finished before the next one starts. 

\ea%x1431
\label{ex:x1431}

tell-2/3s.DS  ascend-SS.SEQ  fire  that1  extinguish-IMP.3p

`Turn around, go and tell the village men and let them come up and extinguish the fire.'

When a clause has a simultaneous action medial verb (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), it indicates at least some overlap with the action in the following clause. 

\ea%x1432
\label{ex:x1432}
\gll Or-\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{omi}  yo  koka  koora=pa  nan  efa  \\

wu-\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{ami}  ma-e-k,  `` ... ''

put-SS.SIM  say-PA-3s

`As he went down he put me in the jungle house and said, `` ... '' '

Simultaneity vs. sequentiality is not always a choice between absolutes; sometimes it is a relative matter. The example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) refers to a situation where a man came back home from a period of labour elsewhere and got married upon arrival. In actual life there may have been a time gap of at least a number of days, possibly longer, but because the two events were so closely linked in the speaker's mind, the simultaneous action form was used when the story was told decades after the events took place.

\ea%x1433
\label{ex:x1433}
\gll Ekap-\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{emi}  yo  efa  aaw-o-k. \\
      \\
\glt
\z

come-SS.SIM  1s.UNM  1s.ACC  take-PA-3s

`He came and married me.'

The simultaneous action form is less marked than the sequential action form: when the relative order of the actions or events is not relevant, the simultaneous action form is used. In the following example, the order of the preparations for a pighunt is not crucial, but the sequential action form on the last medial verb indicates that all the actions take place before leaving, rather than just at the time of leaving.  

\ea%x1437
\label{ex:x1437}

The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} medial verbs (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.5.2}) do not differentiate between sequential and simultaneous action. Sequential action (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is the default interpretation for verbs other than \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}- `be', which is interpreted as simultaneous with the verb in the reference clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). So in order to specify that two or more actions by different participants took place at the same time, the speaker needs to use the continuous aspect form (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

Although the chaining structure itself only specifies the temporal relationship between the clauses and is neutral otherwise, it is open especially for causal/consecutive interpretation. \citet[237]{Reesink1983} notes this for different-subject medial verbs in Usan, and although not very common in Mauwake in general, it is more frequent with \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} predicates than with \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} verbs:

The causal/consecutive interpretation is most common when the object of a transitive medial clause becomes the subject in an intransitive reference clause: in the following example `the son' is the object of the first two clauses and the subject of the final clause.

\ea%x1504
\label{ex:x1504}

\subsection{Person reference in chained clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23161935131865}{}
The switch-reference marking tracks the referents in a different way from the person/number marking in finite verbs. The medial verb suffix indicates whether the clause has the same subject/topic as the reference clause that comes after it, and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} suffixes also have some specification of the subject (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.4.2}). In the following example the subjects are a man and his wife in the first two clauses and in the last one, and a spirit man in all the others:

Because the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking relates to the subject/topic in two different clauses at the same time, this sometimes causes ambiguities that need to be solved. If the subjects in adjacent clauses are partially same and partially different, a choice has to be made whether they are marked as \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} or \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS}; only a few Papuan languages have a choice of marking both \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} and \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} on the same verb \citep{Roberts1997}. Also, if the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking is considered to track the syntactic subject, there are a number of apparent irregularities in the marking. These have been discussed in particular by \citet{Reesink1983a} and \citet{Roberts1988b} with reference to Papuan languages. The next three subsections describe how Mauwake deals with these questions. 

\subsubsection[Partitioning of the participant set]{Partitioning of the participant set}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23181935131865}{}
When one of the subjects is plural and the other is singular included in the plural, this mismatch theoretically allows for a number of different choices in the switch-reference marking, but in practice each language limits this choice in a way peculiar to it.\textsuperscript{} \footnote{For a summary of how different Papuan languages treat this area of ambiguity, see Reesink (1983a, 1987:201-202) and \citet[87-91]{Roberts1988}.} The following table shows for Mauwake, where one alternative has to be chosen and which one, and where there is a choice.

When a plural subject changes into a singular, the suffix is always the one used for same subject.

When a singular subject changes into a plural there is more variation. First person singular changing into plural calls for same-subject marking (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but second person singular switching into first person plural requires different-subject marking even when this second person singular is part of the group denoted by the first person plural (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

When a second person plural switches into a first person plural (including the people indicated by the 2p), the marking has to be for different subject, but in the opposite case, the first person plural changing into the second person plural (again included in the 1p), the marking can be either for same or different subject. Both of these are exemplified in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), repeated below. Here the switch from first person plural to second person plural is marked with the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} marking.

`Later we (by) ourselves will come up and tell you (to come), and when you come down we will sit here together and eat a bit of something and then you (can) walk back.'

With the rest, the speaker has a choice between the two forms. This choice is probably pragmatic and depends on whether the speaker wants to stress the change or the continuity of the referents \citep[47]{Franklin1983}. 

\subsubsection[Tracking a subject high in topicality ]{Tracking a subject high in topicality} 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23201935131865}{}
Haiman and Munro (1983:xi) claim that it is strictly the syntactic subject whose reference is tracked, but this statement has been challenged and modified by several others.\footnote{Giv\'on (1983), Reesink (1983a and 1987), Roberts (1988b and 1997), and \citet{Farr1999} among others.} If it is accepted as such, both Mauwake and other Papuan languages present a number of irregularities that have to be explained somehow.

\citet[242-3]{Reesink1983a} suggests that the switch-reference system does monitor the subject co-referentiality in the medial clause and its reference clause, but topicality considerations cause apparent ``anomalies'' to the basic system.  \citet{Roberts1988b} makes a well supported claim for Amele that in fact it is the topic that is tracked rather than the syntactic subject, or semantic agent, and he tentatively extends the claim to cover other Papuan languages as well. His later survey (1997) presents a more balanced view that \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} can be either agent-oriented or topic-oriented, while maintaining that in most Papuan languages it is topic-oriented. 

In a nominative-accusative language like Mauwake the syntactic subject, the semantic agent and the pragmatic topic coincide most of the time. The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking tracks the subject, but when there is competition between a more topical and less topical subject in clause chains, it is the more topical one that is tracked. An object, even if it is the topic, does not participate in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking.

Competition between a more topical subject with a less topical one most commonly occurs when a clause with an inanimate subject intervenes between clauses where there is an animate/human subject. Even here the ``normal'' \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} strategy is used, if the inanimate subject is topical enough to control the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking in the same way as animate subjects do. In the following examples, the drying of the soup (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and the bending of the coconut palm (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) are important events in the development of the story and so the regular \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking is maintained. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the coconut palm can also be interpreted as a volitional participant, as it bends and straightens itself according to the need of the people.

When an inanimate subject is topically low, the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking of the previous clause disregards it and indicates same-subject continuation, but the verb in the inanimate clause has to indicate a change of subject, if a more topical subject follows. This structure in many Papuan languages is typical of temporal and climate expressions and other impersonal predications (Reesink 1983a, Roberts 1988b), which are often used for giving backgrounded\footnote{\citet[244]{Farr1999} calls this \textit{on-line background} to distinguish it from the off-line background information of subordinate clauses.} information. In the following examples the verb in the initial medial clause predicating the action of human participants is marked with same subject following even when the following clause mentions the coming of darkness or dawn. Returning to the main line action requires different-subject marking. In the examples, the ``skipped'' medial clauses are in brackets.

\z

`They slept, and when it dawned they told their mother, ``{\dots}'' '

If the impersonal predicate is important for the main story line, rather than providing backgrounded information, the impersonal verb itself is placed as a final verb, and the verb in the preceding medial clause is marked for different subject. \citet[206]{Reesink1987} notes a similar rule for Usan. 

\ea%x1492

\z

turn-SS.SEQ  come-SS.SIM-be-2/3p.DS  place  dawn-PA-3s

`They turned and as they were coming, it dawned.'

In many Papuan languages the impersonal predications include a number of experiential verbs (Reesink 1987:204, Roberts 1997). In Mauwake most of the experiential expressions are adjunct plus verb constructions (\sectref{sec:3.8.5.2.1}), where the experiencer is a subject rather than an object; in chained clauses these behave in a regular\textstyleAcronymallcaps{} manner. But those few experiential expressions that are impersonal do not trigger \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} marking in the preceding medial clause, because the inanimate subject in the experiential clause is not topical enough to do it. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the first person singular subject of the medial clauses becomes the object of the final clause, but the medial clause has same subject marking:

\ea%x1491

\z

work-SS.SEQ  work-SS.SEQ  bone=CF  1s.ACC  hurt-Np-PR.3s

`I worked and worked and my bones hurt.'

The verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{weeser}- `finish' is often used in chained clauses to indicate the finishing of an action. In this function its low-topicality subject, the nominalized form of the preceding verb, is never mentioned overtly, and the preceding medial clause has \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} marking:

\ea%x1483
\label{ex:x1483}

`I cooked it and when it was finished alright I put (aside) a little of the meat for these two (women).'

In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) there are two intervening clauses with different low-topicality inanimate subjects. The same-subject marking of the first clause ``jumps over'' these two clauses and refers to the subject in the last clause. The two clauses in between both have \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} marking. 

\ea%x1476

Although human subjects are typically high in the topicality hierarchy (Giv\'on 1984:364), even a human subject may occasionally be so low in topicality that it gets overlooked in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking.\footnote{\citet[236-7]{Reesink1983a} gives similar examples from other Papuan languages.} What is particularly striking with the example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is that the clause that is overlooked has a subject in first person singular, which is usually considered to be topically the highest possible subject. A plausible explanation is that politeness and hospitality requires the host of a big meal to downplay his own importance in this way.

In process descriptions the identity of people performing the actions is not important, and their topicality is low. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the person watching the fire in the coconut drying shed is not mentioned in any way. The example is also like (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) above in that there are two clauses with a different low-topicality subject, here one of them [+human], intervening between the second \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} clause and the final clause, where the original subject is picked up.

\ea%x1481

Even an inanimate subject may override an animate/human one in \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking, if its topicality is high enough. In the following example the subject/topic is \textstyleForeignWords{kunai} grass and the burning of the grass, which is such an important part of a pighunt that the hunt itself is called \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{fiker(a) kuumowa} `kunai-burning'.  The grass is a continuing topic from the previous several sentences, so a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} is not used for marking it.

\subsubsection[Apparent mismatches of reference]{Apparent mismatches of reference}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23221935131865}{}
A medial verb with \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} marking is used in two instances where it does not indicate a change of subject. Both types have two or more clauses with identical \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} marking even though the subject is the same; only the last of those clauses really indicates a change of subject. One of them is recursion of a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} verb, indicating continuity; the identification of the subject is suspended until the repetition ends \citep[201]{Reesink1987}.

A medial clause that has the same subject as the following medial clause may have \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} marking if both the medial clauses relate to the same finite clause as their reference clause, and the first of the medial clauses gets expanded or defined more closely in the second one. The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{DS} verbs may be identical (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but they do not need to be (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SS} medial form of the verb `be' is used in the expression \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naap ikok}  `it is/was thus (and)', regardless of the following subject/topic. The construction seems to have grammaticalized as an expression of an indefinite time span.

Even when the final clause is verbless (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or missing completely because of ellipsis (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), a medial clause is still possible. In both cases the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SR} marking is based on what the expected subject would be, if there were one.

The two sentences preceding the example sentence (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) mention American airplanes that flew over and dropped messages during the Second World War. The ``same subject'' needs to be picked from there -- as the story continues without another reference to the Americans for a while -- and the elliptical clause construed as something like \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naap onamik} `and they did like that'.

\hypertarget{RefHeading23241935131865}{}
Perception verbs in Mauwake mostly use a medial clause as a complementation strategy \citep[371]{Dixon2010}, when the object of the perception verb is an \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{activity}}.\footnote{Reesink notes this for Usan too (1983:237).} Regular, nominalized complement clauses are only used with perception verbs when a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{fact}} is reported (8.3.2.2).

\subsubsection[Tail-head linkage]{Tail-head linkage}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23261935131865}{}
Tail-head linkage is a typical feature especially in oral texts\footnote{With the development of written style this feature is getting less prominent.}  in Papuan languages. It is an inter-sentential cohesive device and could be understood to belong outside ``syntax proper'', if syntax is defined very narrowly. It is mentioned here as it is an important linking device, and the chaining structure is used for it. In narratives and process descriptions tail-head linkage is utilized to tie sentences together within a thematic paragraph. 

 The tail-head link is formed when one sentence ends in a finite clause (``tail''), and the next sentence begins with a medial clause (``head'') that copies the verb but changes it into a medial one. The information in this medial clause is given rather than new, unlike in most other medial clauses. \citet[200-201]{Foley1986} claims for Yimas, and assumes for the rest of Papuan languages, that these medial clauses are subordinate, but at least in Mauwake they are not -- they are coordinate like the other medial clauses. In a narrative the final verbs, which then get recapitulated in the next sentence, carry the core of the story line.

The repeated verb retains its arguments, but there is a choice in how overtly they and the peripherals are marked in the medial clause. Retaining them makes the medial clause more emphatic, and the first element becomes a theme for the new sentence (\sectref{sec:9.1}). In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) only the verbs are copied; (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) copies the subject as well, (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the object and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the locative adverbial.

Most commonly the derivational morphology in the two verbs is identical, but sometimes the derivation in the finite verb is dropped from the medial verb. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) there is a good reason for dropping the benefactive marking from the repeated verb: the spear was thrown for someone's benefit, but it missed and consequently there was no benefit for anyone.

 Similarly, the aspect marking normally stays the same in both the verbs, but it is also possible to have aspect marking on the medial verb, although the finite verb is without any aspect marking (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). When new information is added to the verb either by derivation or aspect marking, it is less clear if this still is a true case of tail-head linkage.

\section{Subordinate clauses: embedding and hypotaxis}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23281935131865}{}
Subordinate clauses are a problematic area to define both cross-linguistically (Haiman \& Thompson 1984, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988:317) and even within one language (Giv\'on 1990:848). It seems that there is a continuum from fully independent to embedded clauses (Reesink 1987:207, Lehmann 1988:189). 

Rather than treating subordinate clauses as one group it is helpful to differentiate between embedding and hypotaxis. Embedded clauses have a function in the main clause: relative clauses as qualifiers within a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP,} complement clauses as objects or subjects, and adverbial clauses as adverbials. Hypotactic clauses are also dependent on the main clause, but they do not function as a constituent in it (Halliday 1985:219, Lehmann 1988). Even though subordination is ``a negative term which lumps together all deviations from some `main clause' norm'' \citep[510]{HaimanEtAl1984}%Thompson
, the term still has limited usefulness, as there are some rules that affect both embedded and hypotactic clauses.  

In Mauwake, subordinate clauses usually precede the main clauses, and they have a non-final intonation pattern. The initial position is related to the pragmatic function of topic that these clauses often have \citep[187]{Lehmann1988}; but when the subordinate clause is right-dislocated, it does not have a topic function.\footnote{For a discussion on the topic function of subordinate clauses see e.g. Reesink (1983b, 1987), Matthiessen and \citet{Thompson1988}, \citet{Lehmann1988} and Thompson, Longacre and \citet{Hwang2007}.}  The semantic function varies according to the type of subordinate clause. 

The embedded clauses in Mauwake are nominalized clauses: relative clause nominalization (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}) (\sectref{sec:8.3.1}) is always done with the demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain}\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{} `that'added to a finite clause, whereas complement clauses (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{CC}) (\sectref{sec:8.3.2}) can use either one of the two nominalization strategies (\sectref{sec:5.7}). The locative and temporal adverbial clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.3}), like the relative clauses, are type 2 nominalized clauses. All of these clauses bear out Reesink's (1983b:236) claim that ``subordinate clauses, especially in sentence-initial position, are natural vehicles for the speaker's presuppositions''.\footnote{``Presuppositions'' here refer to pragmatic, not logical-semantic presuppositions.}  Reesink (ibid. 230) also suggests that the origin of the relative clause is in a paratactic construction. At least in Mauwake this seems to be true not only of the relative clause but of the complement clause (\sectref{sec:8.3.2}) as well. 

The hypotactic conditional and concessive clauses are dependent on their main clause, but not embedded in it. 

\subsection{Relative clauses} 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23301935131865}{}
I define a restrictive relative clause (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}),\footnote{This definition only applies to restrictive relative clauses; non-restrictive RCs (\sectref{sec:8.3.1.4}) are not real RCs although they are structurally similar to the real RCs.} following \citet[206]{Andrews2007b}, as a ``subordinate clause which delimits the reference of a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} by specifying the role of the referent of that \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} in the situation described by the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}''. 

The relative clause is a statement about some noun phrase\textstyleAcronymallcaps{} in the main clause. That \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} is here called the antecedent \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP}),\footnote{This is often called Head NP, but because it is not grammatically a ``head'' of anything, I prefer to call it antecedent NP. The name ``antecedent'' is also somewhat of a misnomer, as in Mauwake it does not \textit{precede} the RelNP.}  since it is the unit that the the coreferential \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} in the relative clause derives its meaning from \citep[20]{Crystal1997}. The coreferential \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} is called the relative \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP}).\footnote{\citet[142]{Keenan1985} calls it a domain noun.}

Often the referent of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} is assumed to be known to the hearer but not necessarily easily accessible, so the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} gives background information to help the hearer identify the referent. 

The relative marker is the distal demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that' (\sectref{sec:3.6.2}) occurring clause-finally in the relative clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). It has a slightly rising non-final intonation indicating that the sentence continues; right-dislocated \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}s have sentence-final falling intonation. Givenness is an essential part of the meaning of the demonstrative, which is also used in \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). The demonstrative in effect makes the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} into a noun phrase. The similarity of the two structures can be seen in the examples below.

\subsubsection[The type and position of the relative clause]{The type and position of the relative clause}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23321935131865}{}
In typological terms the relative clauses in Mauwake are mostly replacive, also called internal. A normal finite clause is made into a noun phrase by the addition of the demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain}, and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} inside the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} replaces the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP}. Pre-nominal \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RCs,} where the\textstyleAcronymallcaps{ RC} precedes the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP,} are cross-linguistically more typical of \textstyleAcronymallcaps{OV} languages than replacive ones \citep[144]{Keenan1985}, but the latter are also common in Papuan languages (Reesink 1983b:229 and 1987:219, Roberts 1987:49, Farr 1999:281, Whitehead 2004:193). Often both pre-nominal and replacive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}s are possible, with one or the other being the dominant type.

`And/but he did not eat the banana(s) that he roasted.'

It is possible to retain the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP}, in which case the relative clause is not replacive but pre-nominal. In Mauwake this is not common; it is used when the noun phrase that is relativized is given extra emphasis. 

\ea%x1532
\label{ex:x1532}

`The day that they went, I do not know the day/date.'

Even though the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} is usually embedded in the main clause, it can be right-dislocated. In that case the main clause contains the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP}, and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} is deleted from the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}. This way the first one of the coreferential \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s  is retained for easier processing. Reasons for right-dislocation are: 1) a long \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}, which would be hard to process sentence-medially, 2) focusing on the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}, or 3) an afterthought: something that the speaker still wants to add.

In a very rare case the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} is deleted and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} is retained in the right-dislocated \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}. What makes it possible in example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) may be that the verb in the main clause can only have some food (or medicine/poison) as its object, so the object, although usually present, may also be left out.

`The men {\dots} came, and we gave it to them to eat, (that is,) the food that we had searched for.'

Comrie presents another typology based on how the role of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} is presented in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}. Basically Mauwake is of the ``gap type'', which ``does not provide any overt indication of the role of the head within the relative clause'' (1981:144-146). Noun phrases get very little case marking for their clausal role, and this is reflected in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} too. This results in ambiguous relative clauses when both a third person subject \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} and a third person object \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} are present in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} and the context does not make the meaning clear enough:

\ea%x1548

      \\
\glt
\z

dog  cat  bite-PA-3s  that1  die-PA-3s

`The dog that bit the cat died.' Or: `The dog that the cat bit died.'

The ambiguity can be avoided by adding the contrastive focus marker to the subject when the object is fronted to the theme position.\footnote{For some reason this is done in relative clauses mainly with human subjects, although the contrastive focus marker can be added to non-human subjects as well.}  Although this is not case marking, it can function as such, because the subject is the best candidate for contrastive focus marking (\sectref{sec:3.12.7.2}).

\ea%x1549

`I saw the man whose wife hit him.'

Comrie's (1981:140) ``non-reduction type'' is exhibited in Mauwake by those few cases where the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} keeps its oblique case marking. With overt case marking on the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP}, the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} has to be retained:

`The axe with which I cut trees became blunt.'

But when the case marking does not appear in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC,} the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} is not present in the main clause either, and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} is a gapping-type relative clause:

\ea%x1541

\subsubsection[The structure of the relative clause ]{The structure of the relative clause} 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23341935131865}{}
In Mauwake the most typical relative clause is syntactically like a finite main clause, plus the distal-1 deictic \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} functioning as a clause final relative marker. It was mentioned in \sectref{sec:5.7.2} that this is one strategy for nominalizing clauses in Mauwake. The demonstrative as a possible origin of a relative marker is well attested cross-linguistically (e.g. Dixon 2010b:342). 

The verb of the relative clause is a fully inflected finite verb. But when a non-verbal clause is a relative clause, it has no verb and is structurally like other non-verbal clauses. 

\ea%x1943
\label{ex:x1943}

do-SS.SIM-PA-1/3p

`And they themselves kept making bridges to rivers that didn't have them.'

The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} tends to be initial in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} regardless of its syntactic function. This is because it often has the pragmatic function of theme, which takes the clause-initial position. The initial position is easy to have also because a typical clause in Mauwake has so few noun phrases: in many \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}s the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} is the only noun phrase. 

\ea%x1552

`They\textsubscript{i} bought from them\textsubscript{j} the taro that they\textsubscript{j} brought down.'

When a personal pronoun functions as a subject and the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} in some other syntactic role, the pronoun tends to keep its initial position, thus maintaining the basic constituent order. The personal pronouns are high in the topicality hierarchy (Giv\'on 1976:166), so it is natural that they tend to keep the clause-initial and also sentence-initial position.  Since the object \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{sirirowa} `pain' in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is not fronted, a temporal adverbial also keeps a place it would have in a neutral main clause. 

The tense in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} can be past (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or present (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but not future. For future meaning, the present tense form has to be used (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x1531

As was mentioned above, the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} only rarely shows overtly. But a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} can also be deleted if it is generic (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or recoverable from situational (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or textual context (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). In the example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the deleted \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} can either be generic `what/whatever' or it may be \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{opora} `talk'; in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the speaker is describing the process of making a fishtrap, which has already been mentioned in previous sentences.

In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) there is no other indication of the  \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} than the person suffix of the verb. The group of women referred to were mentioned as a noun phrase only near the beginning of the story, whereas the example is from close to the end:

\ea%x1556
\label{ex:x1556}
\gll Domora=pa  or-omi  nan  ik-e-mik,  [afa  \\

`They went down from Domora and were there, those (women) who became flying foxes.'

In the following two examples the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RCs} are identical, but they have a different \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP}. The \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} of (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{mukuruna} `noise', but the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} of (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{wi} `they', only shows in the verbal suffix. The obligatory accusative pronoun in the main clause provides a key for the interpretation of (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

The antecedent in most relative clauses has a specific reference. When the reference is generic, in Mauwake a very generic noun is chosen as the head of the relativized \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} and that is modified by a question word. So called free \citep[213]{Andrews2007b} or condensed \citep[359]{Dixon2010b} relative clauses,\footnote{They are also called headless RCs; see \citet[317,360]{Dixon2010b} for a criticism of this.} which usually replace the whole \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} with a generic or interrogative pronoun, are not used in Mauwake. 

\ea%x1562

When the antecedent is generic and human, there are two more possibilities for the RelNP: it may be \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{mua} `man, person' or the third person singular pronoun, plus the specifier \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ena} (\sectref{sec:3.12.7.1}).

Non-verbal descriptive clauses can be made into relative clauses, but it is only in the negative that they are recognizable as such. In the affirmative they are exactly like noun phrases with a demonstrative, and because the meanings are so similar, it can be questioned whether there is such a thing as an affirmative non-verbal descriptive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} at all in Mauwake.  

\ea%x1550

\gll [Mua  eliwa  nain]  kookal-i-yem. \\
      \\
\glt
\z

`I like the good man.' Or `I like the man that is good.'

In the negative these clauses are different from the noun phrases because the negation is placed before the non-verbal predicate.

\ea%x1551

\subsubsection[Relativizable noun phrase positions]{Relativizable noun phrase positions}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23361935131865}{}
Several \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} functions can be relativized, and Mauwake conforms to Keenan and Comrie's (1977) Noun phrase accessibility hierarchy:\footnote{As Mauwake adjectives do not have comparative forms there can be no relativization for an object of comparison, which in Keenan and Comrie's hierarchy is the hardest to relativize.}  the higher up a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} is in the hierarchy, the easier it is to relativise. Noun phrases with the following functions can be relativized: subject, object, recipient, beneficiary, instrument, comitative, object of genitive, temporal and locative. 

Subject (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and object (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) are the most frequent functions of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP}.

When an instrument is relativized, the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} either takes the instrumental case marking (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or has no case marking (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}): 

\ea%x1553

`Alright they distributed the many things with which they had covered her (body).'

A comitative \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} (4.1.3) containing a comitative postposition may be relativized (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but one formed with a comitative clitic may not. 

\ea%x1542
\label{ex:x1542}

`That man with whom I went became sick.'

The object of genitive, or object of \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{possessive}} as it should be called when describing Mauwake grammar, only uses the dative pronoun (\sectref{sec:3.5.5}) when relativized (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), not the unmarked (\sectref{sec:3.5.2.1}) or genitive (\sectref{sec:3.5.4}) pronoun.

\ea%x1543

Temporal and locative \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}s are structurally identical to the other \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}s when the relativized temporal or locative \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} does not have an adverbial function in the main clause.

When the relativized temporal \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} is a temporal in the main clause as well, the relative marker can optionally be replaced by the locative deictic \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nan} or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{neeke} `there'.

\ea%x1625

`The day that mother gave birth, father went to Madang.'

When the relativized locative \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} is also a constituent in the main clause, the relative marker has to be replaced by \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nan} or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{neeke} (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x1622

Temporal adverbial clauses, which are structurally close to relative clauses, are discussed below in \sectref{sec:8.3.3.1}, and locative adverbial clauses in \sectref{sec:8.3.3.2}.

\subsubsection[Non-restrictive relative clauses]{Non-restrictive relative clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23381935131865}{}
Non-restrictive, or appositional, relative clauses are structurally exactly like restrictive relative clauses, but their function is different. They do not delimit the reference of the antecedent \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}, instead, they give new information about it. Functionally they are like a coordinate clause added to the main clause.

Because of the structural and even intonational similarity it is sometimes difficult to tell if a particular \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} is restrictive or non-restrictive. When the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} is a proper noun or when it includes a first or second person singular pronoun the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} is usually non-restrictive:

\ea%x1567
\label{ex:x1567}
\gll Bang=ke  ekap-o-k,  [Ponkila  aaw-o-k  nain]. \\
      \\
\glt
\z

Bang=CF  come-PA-3s  Ponkila  get-PA-3s  that1

\glt
\z

1s.UNM  2s.GEN  village  taro  no(ne)  that1  dislike-Np-PR.1s

`I don't like your village, which doesn't have taro.'

The proximate demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{fain} `this' can also function as a relative marker in the non-restrictive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC}s but not in restrictive ones:

\ea%x1536
\label{ex:x1536}
\gll Nomokowa  unowa  fan-e-mik,  [Simbine \\

ekap-omak-e-mik  fain].

come-DISTR/PL-PA-1/3p  this

`Your many (clan) brothers are here, these Simbine people who came.'

When the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} is a pronoun other than first or second singular, the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} may be either restrictive or non-restrictive.

\ea%x1570
\label{ex:x1570}
\gll I  mua  yiam  ikur,  [fikera  ikiw-e-mik  nain]. \\

`There were five of us men who went to the kunai grass (= pig-hunting).' Or: `We were five men, who went pig-hunting.'

\subsection{Complement clauses and other complementation strategies}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23401935131865}{}
The prototypical function of a complement clause is as a subject or object in a main clause. In Mauwake a complement clause proper functions as an object of a complement-taking verb (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{CTV}), and occasionally as a subject in a non-verbal clause. Structurally it is a type 2 nominalized clause: a finite clause that has the distal-1 demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that' occurring as a nominaliser clause-finally (\sectref{sec:5.7.2}). The complement clause precedes the complement-taking verb. The complement clause differs from the relative clause in that none of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NPs} inside it is an \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} or a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP}. 

The division of complements into different types, ``Fact, Activity and Potential'', that \citet[371]{Dixon2010b} provides, is crucial for the use of the different complementation strategies in Mauwake.  A complement clause is normally used when a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{CTV} needs a fact-type object complement.

Besides the regular complement clause described above, Mauwake has other complementation strategies. The indirect speech clauses are ordinary sentences embedded in the utterance clause (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.2}). Medial clauses are used as the main complementation strategy for activity-type complements with perception verbs (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.2}). Clauses with a nominalized verb are used for potential-type complements with various \textstyleAcronymallcaps{CTV}s. The regular complement clause and the clause with a nominalized verb may occur as a subject of a clause (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.5}). 

Since one \textstyleAcronymallcaps{CTV} can take more than one complementation strategy, the main grouping below is done according to the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{CTV}s.

\subsubsection[Complements of utterance verbs]{Complements of utterance verbs}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23421935131865}{}
Some utterance verbs (\sectref{sec:3.8.4.4.6}) are also used for thinking, so speech and thought are discussed as one group. 

The status of direct quote clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.1}) as complement clauses is questionable, but they are discussed here because of their co-occurrence with the utterance verbs and their similarity with the indirect quotes (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.2}), which are complement clauses.  

The most important of the utterance verbs is \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na}- `say, think'. It is used as the utterance verb for indirect quote complements, which in turn have grammaticalized, together with the same subject sequential form of the verb, as desiderative (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.3}) and purpose clauses (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.4}) and the conative construction (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.5}) 

\paragraph[Direct speech]{Direct speech}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23441935131865}{}
It seems to be a universal feature of direct quote clauses that they behave independently of their matrix clauses. If they are considered complement clauses of utterance verbs, their independence sets them apart from all the other complement clauses \citep[303]{Munro1982}. \citet[398]{Dixon2010} maintains that direct speech quotes are not any kind of complementation.

A direct quote may be a whole discourse on its own, not just a clause within a sentence.

It is rather typical in Papuan languages to have a strict quote formula both before and after a quotation, or at least before it (Franklin 1971:120, Davies 1981:1, Roberts 1987:12, Farr 1999, Hepner 2002:128). It is also common that either there is no separate structure for indirect speech \citep[2]{Davies1981} or that direct and indirect speech are so similar that they are often hard to distinguish from each other \citep[14]{Roberts1987}. 

In the use of quote formulas Mauwake is much freer than Papuan languages in general. A direct quotation in Mauwake is often preceded or followed by one of the utterance verbs. The verbs \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na}- `say/think' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naak}- `say/tell' are almost exclusively used after quotes. Enclosing a quote between two utterance verbs is not frequent:

\ea%x1571
\label{ex:x1571}
\gll Ne  ona  mua  pun  \textbf{ma-e-k},  ``Eka  maneka  nain=ke \\
      \\

come-SS.SIM  kill-PA-3s  say-PA-3s

`Her husband also said, ``The big river came and killed her,'' he said.'

Most commonly a speech verb only preceeds the quote:

\ea%x1578

`She dished out (the food) and told the children, ``Take the food to father.'' '

An single utterance verb or a whole quote-closing clause may follow the quote. A quote-closing clause has to be used when the quotation consists of several sentences.

\ea%x1580

In narratives where there are several exchanges between the participants, it is possible to leave out the utterance verb and even the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} referring to the speaker of the utterance, if that is clear enough from the context.

\paragraph[Indirect speech]{Indirect speech}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23461935131865}{}
Indirect speech quotes, which report speech or thought, are objects of speech verbs. 

Most indirect quotes in Mauwake are syntactically identical to direct quotes. There is an intonational difference: the indirect quote is part of the intonation contour of the main clause, rather than having a contour of its own as a direct quote has. The quote is almost always followed by the utterance verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na}- `say, think'; but it is also possible for the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ma}- `say' to precede it, in which case both the utterance verb and the quote have their own intonation contour (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).\footnote{In Amele the absence of the speech verb before the quote is the main criterion for indirect speech \citep[14]{Roberts1987}. In Mauwake it cannot be used as a criterion, as the occurrence of speech verbs with direct quotes varies so much.} An indirect quote is never enclosed between two utterance verbs. 

\ea%x1585

As direct quotes behave independently of their matrix clauses, they often have a separate deictic centre. But indirect quotes vary in this respect. Deictic elements, which get part or all of their interpretation from the situational context, are often the same in indirect quotes as they would be in direct quotes: 

\ea%x1584

2p.ACC  call-2/3s.DS  3s.GEN  family  3.DAT  be-PA-2p

`Christ called you to be his family and (now) you are his family.'

But the deictic centre may also shift partly or completely towards that of the matrix clause. When this happens, the pronouns are the easiest to change, next the adverbs. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) a second person pronoun has replaced the proper name or third person pronoun that would have been used in a direct quote.

\ea%x1586
\label{ex:x1586}
\gll Sarak  oo,  Amerika  ekap-ep  Ulingan  nan  ik-e-mik,  \\

2s.ACC  wonder.about-Np-PR.1/3p  say-Np-PR.1/3p  INTJ

`Sarak! The Americans have come and are in Ulingan and they say that they are wondering where you are!'

When reported by the addressee of the example clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), only the pronoun in the reported clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is different:

\ea%x1281
\label{ex:x1281}
\gll No  owowa  ikiw-ep  buk  nain  sesek-om-e. \\

efa  na-e-k.

1s.ACC  say-PA-3s

`He told me to send that book to him (lit: me) when I would go to the village.'

The verbs are most resistant to deictic shift. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), even though the verb root changes, it still retains the tense and person marking of the direct quote (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). Both the temporal adverb and the pronoun are shifted to reflect the deictic centre of the matrix clause.

\ea%x1267
\label{ex:x1267}
\gll Ona  owowa=pa  ik-ua. \\

      \\
\glt
\z

say-PA-1s  2s.GEN  village=LOC  be-PA-2s

`I said (to her) that you are in your own village.'

The deictic shift would need more study to ascertain if there are specific rules governing this variation in indirect quotes.

When the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na}- `say, think' indicates thinking, the complement clause is usually an indirect quote rather than a direct one. 

\ea%x1588
\label{ex:x1588}
\gll [Muuka  ifera  me  enim-i-non]  na-ep  me  uruf-a-m. \\

\paragraph[Desiderative clauses]{Desiderative clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23481935131865}{}
It is very common in Papuan languages that an indirect quote construction with the intended action verb in future tense, imperative or irrealis form expresses a want/wish\footnote{In Mauwake the verb \textit{kookal}- `like, love, desire', is mostly used with a NP object, but it can take a clausal complement as well. It does not indicate intention or purpose. The complement is either type of the nominalized clauses (5.7).}, desire or intention to do something. (Reesink 1987:254-9, Foley 1986:157, Hardin 2003:112, Hepner 2002:76-7).

In Mauwake the future, imperative, counterfactual and nominalized forms of the main verb are possible in the complement. In the desiderative clauses the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na-} `say/think' is always in the medial same-subject sequential form \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naep}; in purpose clauses other forms are possible as well. Historically, there probably always used to be a clause with a finite verb following the clause expressing intention or desire (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}); synchronically the finite clause is often missing (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), especially when the verb would be the same as in the complement.

1s.UNM  talk  little=NF  say-Np-FU.1s  say-SS.SEQ

`I want to tell a little story.' Or: `I'm going to tell a little story.'

The main verb in the complement is either marked for first person\footnote{Purpose clauses may use other person forms as well (\sectref{sec:8.3.2.1.4}).} or is nominalized. Mauwake uses the future (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or imperative form (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) of the main verb for intention or a clear/certain wish, and the counterfactual form for a wish that has less potential to be realized. The latter is also the most polite form to use, if the wish indicates a request (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

The nominalized form is mostly used in complement clauses that can also be interpreted as purpose clauses. In ``pure'' desiderative clauses it is practical to use the nominalized form especially if the first person marking in the verb might make it harder to process the meaning:

\ea%x1610

`And if they want to see him and help him with food, let them help him.'

\paragraph[Purpose clauses]{Purpose clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23501935131865}{}
Purpose is both conceptually close and structurally similar to desiderative, and in Mauwake many of the desiderative clauses can be interpreted as purpose clauses. This is particularly so when the main verb is in the nominalized form. But a truly desiderative clause even with an action nominal is never right-dislocated, whereas a purpose clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) often is. The nominalized form in the main verb is common:

Future and imperative forms are also used in the purpose clause. When the subject in the purpose clause is the same as the subject of the utterance verb and the main clause, the first person future form is used for singular and first person dual imperative for plural.

When the subject of the verb in the main clause differs from that of the purpose clause, the verb inside the purpose clause has to be in the imperative. The whole purpose clause is structurally like a direct quote of the ``inner speech'' verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naep}, so there is no deictic shift of the kind that may take place in indirect quotes.

Instead of using a verbal construction with the verb `see' for conative modality -- expressing the attempt to do something -- which \citet[152]{Foley1986} claims as almost universal for Papuan languages, Mauwake makes use of a structure where the desiderative is followed by the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{on-} `do' as the verb in its reference clause. Usan uses an identical construction for the same purpose \citep[258]{Reesink1987}.

The conative structure is not used when the effort is successful (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), and also when the `trying' is not so much an effort to do something as experimenting (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).  In these cases the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{akim-} `try' is used. It requires a nominalized verb in the complement clause.

\hypertarget{RefHeading23541935131865}{}
The verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ma}- `say, talk' can take a regular complement clause, which is of the fact type \citep[389]{Dixon2010b}. This clause functions as an object of the verb in the same way as a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} with the head noun \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{opora} (or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{opaimika}) `talk/story' in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

\ea%x1595

      \\
\glt
\z

talk  little=NF  say-Np-FU.1s  say/think-SS.SEQ

`I want to tell a little story.'

The complement clause says something about the contents of the story and functions as a kind of title. This type of structure is quite common in Papuan languages\footnote{\citet[231]{Reesink1987} treats them under relative clauses and considers them equivalents of English cleft sentences.} and is used mainly in an opening or closing formula in narrative texts: 

\ea%x1596
\label{ex:x1596}
\gll Aria  yo  aakisa  [takira  en-owa  gelemuta  wia  \\

make-BEN-BNFY2.PA-1/3p  that1  say-Np-PR.1s

`Alright now I tell about our making a little feast for the children.'

The complement ``clause'' may actually be a whole sentence, since it is possible to have medial clauses preceding the finite clause of the complement:

\ea%x1597
\label{ex:x1597}
\gll [Tunde=pa  fikera  kuum-iwkin  ikiw-ep  waaya  \\
      \\

spear-PA-1s  that1  say-Np-PR.1s

`I tell about that when they burned kunai grass on Tuesday and I went and speared a pig.'

Often the sentence has both a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} containing a word for `story' and the complement clause (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). The relationship of these two \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s is not really appositional, because the nominalized clause modifies the other \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}. But the nominalized clause is not a prototypical \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC} either, in spite of identical structure, because \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{opora} is neither an \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AntNP} nor a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP} that would have a function in the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RC.} I consider the nominalized clause a modifier of the other \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}, and the whole comparable to the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).\footnote{Comrie and \citet{Horie1995} present another alternative: treating complement clauses like this and relative clauses as a single construction, where the structure only indicates that the subordinate clause is connected to a NP, and the interpretation of their relationship is done pragmatically. This possibility would need more investigation in Mauwake.}

Another complementation strategy for utterance verbs is a clause with a nominalized verb. It is used when the event expressed in the clause is regarded as potential, rather than an actual activity or a fact. The following example has two levels of complementation, as the verb in the nominalized complement also takes a nominalized complement:

\ea%x1599

`While we were talking about our going to fetch a vehicle, she died (lit: became).'

The same strategy is used with the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{maak}- `tell' when it is used in the sense of ordering someone to do something: 

\ea%x1630

\gll Emar,  [no  muut  fain  uf-owa]  nefa  maak-e-m. \\

\subsubsection[Complements of perception verbs]{Complements of perception verbs}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23561935131865}{}
It was mentioned above (\sectref{sec:8.2.3.4}) that the chaining structure is used with perception verbs in Mauwake as the main complementation strategy for perception verbs, when the complement is an activity or event. These are not genuine complement clauses, as they are not embedded in the main clause, but they perform the same function as regular complement clauses do. 

\ea%x1512

A regular complement clause is only used with perception verbs about a past activity, when the complement clause reports a fact rather than an activity. 

\ea%x1628

\subsubsection[Complements of cognitive verbs]{Complements of cognitive verbs}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23581935131865}{}
The verbs for knowing, \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{amisar}- and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{paayar}- together cover the cognitive area of knowing facts and skills, coming to realize, and understanding. When the complement clause indicates contents of factual knowledge it is usually a regular complement clause.

\ea%x1602
\label{ex:x1602}
\gll O  [kaanek  aaw-ep  p-ekap-om-a-mik \\

nain]  me  amis-ar-e-k.

that1  not  knowledge-INCH-PA-3s

`He didn't know where they got it from and brought to him.'

It seems that a clause with a nominalized verb is also used as a ``fact'' complement but only when it refers to pre-knowledge of an event. It could also be understood as a ``potential'' type complement, in which case it is natural that it uses this complementation strategy. This requires more investigation. 

\ea%x1605
\label{ex:x1605}
\gll [O  ikiw-owa  nain]  amis-ar-e-n=i? \\
      \\
\glt
\z

3s.UNM  go-NMZ  that1  knowledge-INCH-PA-2s=QM

`Did you know about his going?'

When the complement is about knowing a skill, the verb in the complement clause is in nominalized form, or a medial clause is used: 

\ea%x1603
\label{ex:x1603}
\gll [Nain  on-owa  (nain)]  me  amis-ar-e-m. \\
      \\
\glt

      \\
\glt
\z

Sawiter  basket  make-SS.SEQ  knowledge-INCH-PA-3s

`Sawiter knows how to make baskets.'

When the complement indicates lack of some experience, a construction with a medial clause is used. In this case the main clause is in the negative, and the scope of the negation has to extend to the medial clause:

\ea%x1604
\label{ex:x1604}
\gll [Owora  en-ep]  me  paayar-e-m. \\
      \\
\glt

\subsubsection[Complement clauses as subjects]{Complement clauses as subjects}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23601935131865}{}
Both types of a nominalized clause (\sectref{sec:5.7.1}, 5.7.2) may be used as subjects in verbless clauses, even though this function for complement clauses is not common. A clause with a nominalized verb is used when the activity is potential (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x1636
\label{ex:x1636}

\subsection{Adverbial clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23621935131865}{}
Adverbial clauses are a very small group of subordinate clauses. They are type two nominalized clauses, and they perform the same function in a clause as a temporal or locative adverbial phrase. 

\subsubsection[Temporal clauses ]{Temporal clauses} 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23641935131865}{}
The presence of the distal-1 demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that' indicates the pragmatic difference between the temporal clauses and those medial clauses that may get a temporal interpretation: the temporal clauses are presented as given information, whereas the medial clauses usually present new information (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), except when they occur in Tail-Head constructions.

\subsubsection[Locative clauses]{Locative clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23661935131865}{}
Locative adverbial clauses use a clause-final deictic locative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nan} or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{neeke} `there' instead of the demonstrative  \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that'. Note that in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the locative noun \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{manina} `garden' is not a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{RelNP}; if there were one, that would be \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{epa} `place' immediately preceding \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nan} `there'.

\subsection{Adversative subordinate clause } 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23681935131865}{}
The coordinate adversative clauses were discussed in \sectref{sec:8.1.3}.

The topic marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na} (\sectref{sec:3.12.7.1}) marks an adversative clause when the main clause cancels an expectation, either expressed in the text or assumed to be in the hearer's mind. Because of this, this construction is used when some effort is frustrated (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or when there is a strong element of surprise (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) in the main clause.

Because these clauses express a cancellation or frustration of an expectation, a negator commonly follows as the first element in the main clause, and often the negator is the only element left of the main clause, as in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\subsection{Conditional clauses} 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23701935131865}{}
\citet{Haiman1978} was the first one to clearly describe the close connection between conditionals and topics, and it has since then been attested in various languages (Thompson, Longacre and Hwang 2007:292). In many Papuan languages the connection is very evident (Reesink 1987:235-244, MacDonald 1990:304-308, Farr 1999:263). The protasis -- the subordinate clause expressing the condition -- provides the presupposition for the apodosis, the asserted main clause. Or, ``it constitutes the framework which has been selected for the following discourse'' \citep[585]{Haiman1978}.

Conditional clauses in Mauwake can be grouped into three main groups on semantic and structural grounds: imaginative, predictive and reality conditionals.\footnote{The terminology is from Thompson, Longacre and \citet[255]{Hwang2007}.} The imaginative and predictive conditionals together belong to the unreality conditionals. The reality conditionals only include habitual/generic conditionals, as there are no present or past conditionals.

The protasis is placed before the apodosis. Right-dislocation of the protasis is possible but rare. The verb forms in the protasis and the apodosis depend on the type of conditional.

The topic marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na} is used as the conditional marker in the unreality conditional clauses, where it is cliticized to the last element of the protasis clause, usually the verb. The reality conditional clauses do not have a conditional marker, so structurally the protasis and apodosis are ordinary juxtaposed clauses. 

The intonation in the protasis has a slight rise towards the end.  

In imaginative conditional clauses the verb in both the protasis and the apodosis is in the counterfactual mood, which is marked by the suffix -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ek}. The conditional/topic marker -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{na} is always present. The same form is used for semantically counterfactual and hypothetical conditionals. The counterfactual interpretation (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is more common, but especially if there is a reference to present (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or future time (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), it forces hypothetical interpretation.

`If it were the white man's sickness\footnote{This is contrasted with \textit{owow napuma} `village sickness', caused by sorcery.} he would recover.' Or: `If it had been the white man's sickness, he would have recovered.'

The predictive conditionals are the most frequently used and show the greatest variation morphologically. The apodosis, and consequently the whole sentence, may be either a statement with a future tense verb, or a command with an imperative verb. The verb in the protasis may be in either present or future indicative, in imperative, or in medial form. The conditional/topic marker at the end of the protasis is obligatory. 

When the predictive conditional is a statement, usually the verb in both the protasis and in the apodosis is in the future tense.

The protasis may have a medial verb form if the condition is likely to be fulfilled (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or when the protasis consists of two or more clauses that are in a medial-final relationship (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

The predictive conditionals allow right-dislocation of the protasis, but it is uncommon:

`Give these betelnuts to old mother to eat, if she comes and arrives here.'

Also those instances where the conditional marker is attached to a predicate that is not originally a verb, the predicate needs to have medial verb marking (\sectref{sec:3.8.3.4.2}).

When the apodosis is in the imperative, there is normally some expectation that the the condition is to be fulfilled. When the likelihood is high, the medial form is used in the protasis (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}),(\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). Present tense (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and imperative (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) indicate less, and future tense (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the least likelihood for the condition to be fulfilled.

The reality conditional clauses are morpho-syntactically different from the other conditional clauses in that they are not marked with the topic marker. The protasis and apodosis are juxtaposed main clauses in future tense, but this construction is mainly used to encode habitual or generic conditions. The protasis can never be right-dislocated, since it does not have the topic marker.

`If you don't call the spirit name, another man will spear the pig and take it from you.'

If there are two protasis clauses, they may be juxtaposed without a connective (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or joined with the pragmatic additive \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x1635

`If I die and my wife takes another husband, she will not go (to him) with the son.'

When a sentence contains alternatives expressed by two sets of reality conditional constructions, these are joined by the pragmatic additive \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}.

\ea%x1642
\label{ex:x1642}
\gll [Yo  auwa  miiwa=pa  mauw-i-nen],  irak-owa  marew,  ne \\

1s  1s/p.moher  land=LOC  work-Np-FU.1s  fight-NMZ  be-Np-FU.3s

`If I work on my father's land there is no fighting (over land), but if I work on my mother's land there will be fighting.'

The same construction can encode a simple coordinate relationship, but it is less common. In spoken text a slightly falling intonation at the end of the first clause indicates a coordinate sentence.

\ea%x1850
\label{ex:x1850}
\gll Oko-ke  pusun-emi  feeke  \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{ikiw}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{-}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{i}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{-}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{non},  a  mua   \\

\subsection{Concessive clauses}
\hypertarget{RefHeading23721935131865}{}
Concessive clauses may look exactly like the predictive conditional clauses. If the context is not clear enough, the phrase \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain pun} `that too' may be added between the protasis and the apodosis for clarification.  

\ea%x1655

\subsection{Coordination of subordinate clauses} 
\hypertarget{RefHeading23741935131865}{}
Subordinate clauses may also be coordinated with each other, although in normal speech the frequency of these constructions is low. The only subordinate clauses in the natural text data conjoined either by juxtaposition or with the additive \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne}  are relative clauses. The distal demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain}, functioning as a relative marker, is attached to the end of each relative clause.
