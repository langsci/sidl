\section{Phrase level syntax}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21621935131865}{}\subsection{Noun phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21641935131865}{}The noun phrase in Mauwake functions in a clause as subject, object or non-verbal predicate. It can also function in an adverbial phrase, or as a possessor, qualifier or post-modifier in another noun phrase.

\subsubsection{Basic noun phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21661935131865}{}The the most common noun phrase structure consists of only the head noun. That is slightly more frequent than a head noun plus one or more attributive elements. The head noun may have either pre- or postmodifiers, or both. The relative order of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} constituents is as follows:\footnote{The superscript \textsuperscript{n} indicates that it is possible to have more than one of these constituents within a single NP.}

{\bfseries
Unmarked/Genitive pronoun - Temporal phrase - Possessive NP - Genitive pronoun - Qualifying NP - HEAD NOUN - Modifying NP - Adjective phrase\textsuperscript{n} - Quantifier phrase\textsuperscript{n} / Indefinite - Demonstrative - Dative pronoun}

The relative clause, where the head noun is modified by a whole clause, is discussed in {\S}8.3.1.

The order of \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} constituents following the head noun agrees with a cross-linguistic generalization of \textstyleAcronymallcaps{SOV} languages:  N-A-Num-Dem \citep[112]{Dryer2007a}.

Theoretically it is quite possible, and grammatically correct, to have a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} like the one in (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), but natural language data seldom has any \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s with more than two modifiers; example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is one of those.

The only modifier in a noun phrase most typically is either a possessor (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), a deictic (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or a qualifying noun or noun phrase \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) the qualifying noun is a compound noun.

In the following, each \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} position is discussed in turn, starting with the leftmost one.  

An \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{unmarked third person plural pronoun}} is used as an optional plural marking for humans and other human-like beings (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x398
\label{ex:x398}
\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Wi}\emphs{  sawur=ke  kuura  puuk-a-mik.} \\
      \\

3p.UNM  spirit=CF  fly  cut-PA-1/3p

      \\
\glt
\z

ADD  there  3p.ACC  village  man  3p.ACC  tell-PA-1/3p

`And there they told the village men, {\dots}'

The plural-marking pronoun differs from the appositive use (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) of the unmarked pronoun in that the former is unstressed, whereas the latter is stressed and, furthermore, may be any person and either singular or plural. (For appositional NPs, see {\S}4.1.4.)

\ea%x399
\label{ex:x399}
\gll \textbf{'}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Yo}\emphs{  nena  niawi=ke  nefa  maak-i-yem.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

1s.UNM  2s.GEN  2s/p.father=CF  2s.ACC  tell-Np-PR.1s

`I, your father, tell you...'

A special case of the plural-marking unmarked pronoun is where it occurs with a place name to refer to the people of that place (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).  The head noun \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{mua} `men, people' or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{emeria}\emphs{} \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{mua} `people' is not needed; it may be used, but is usually left out.

\ea%x400
\label{ex:x400}
\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Wi}\emphs{  Lasen=ke  ekap-e--mik.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

1p.UNM  Lasen=CF  come-PA-1/3p

`The Lasen (village) people came.'

A \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{temporal phrase}} is rare as a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} constituent. Mainly the temporal words \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aakis}  'present-day' from \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aakisa} 'now, today' (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iiriw} 'earlier' (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) may be used, but a temporal phrase is also allowed : 

\ea%x401
\label{ex:x401}
\gll \emphs{ni } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{aakis}\emphs{  takira }\\
      \\
\glt

      \\
\glt
\z

3p.UNM  earlier  truly  man

`the people of long ago'

The structure of the two pre-modifying \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s, possessive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} and qualifying \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}, is similar to that of the basic \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}. It is because of their position and function inside another \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} that they are here called by different names.

The head noun of a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{possessive} }\textstyleAcronymallcaps{\textup{NP}} can only be [+human], with `human' including spirits (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and sometimes some domestic animals like dogs or pigs (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). The humanness of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{PossNP} is stressed by the fact that it may be followed by a pronoun copy in the genitive (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x402

The head noun of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{PossNP} may itself be possessed:

`the wives of the ``weria-men''\footnote{The \textit{weria}{}-men are relatives responsible for a person's burial. For more information, see {\S}1.3.6.} of us widows'

The semantic relation of the ``possessor'' to the ``possessed'' may be that of real ownership, paraphrasable with `have' (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), a human relationship (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), origin (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or subjecthood (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x406

Either an unmarked pronoun or a genitive pronoun may be used as a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{possessive pronoun}}. Often the two can be used interchangeably, but the following rules and tendencies have been observed. When the pronoun is a pronoun copy of a preceding possessive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} it must be in the genitive (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x409
\label{ex:x409}
\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Ona}\emphs{  apura  maa  oposia  me  enim-i-non.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

      \\
\glt
\z

spirit  woman  3s.GEN  3s/p.mother  3s/p.father

`the spirit woman's parents'

An unmarked pronoun is used especially with things that are closely related to a person, and the genitive pronoun tends to be used more when the ownership is emphasized. 

\ea%x1315
\label{ex:x1315}
\gll \emphs{Oo, } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{no  emeria}\emphs{  iiriw  sesek-a-mik.} \\

\glt

talk=INST  1p.ACC  tell-SS.SIM-be-PA-1/3p

`They did not know Tok Pisin and talked to us in their (own) language.'

An unmarked pronoun used possessively is often stressed in speech (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x408
\label{ex:x408}
\gll \emphs{Nain } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{'i } \emphs{sira=ke.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

that1  1p.UNM  custom=CF

`That is our custom.'

In recursive genitive structures like (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) more than one possessive pronoun may occur as a pronoun copy, so (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is a possible alternative for (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

\ea%x411
\label{ex:x411}
\gll \emphs{i  emeria  apura } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{yiena}\emphs{  mua  weria } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{wiena} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

1p.UNM  woman  widow  1p.GEN  man  planting.stick  3p.GEN

\emphs{emeria  nain=ke}

woman  that1=CF

`the wives of the ``weria-relatives'' of us widows'

A \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{qualifying noun phrase}} usually consists of the head noun only. If it has other elements, the structure is the same as that of the basic \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}. The distinction between a qualifying \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} and a possessive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} on the one hand, and between a qualifying \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} and a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{N+N} compound on the other, is often hard to make. (See {\S}3.2.5  for a discussion on the distinction between compound nouns and \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s.) Unlike a possessive \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}, a qualifying \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} may not take a genitive pronoun copy.

`When it gets dark in the afternoon he will follow the ``dog man'' (a certain nominated person in the \textit{singsing} traditions).'

A place name may be a qualifier for a locative noun functioning as head noun.

\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Bogia}\emphs{  era} \\

\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{Malala}\emphs{  owowa} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

Malala  village

`Malala village'

The qualifying \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} can also be a nominalized clause; this is most common when the head noun is an abstract noun like \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{sira} `custom' or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{opora} `talk, story'.

\ea%x414
\label{ex:x414}
\gll [\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{garanga}\textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{  oko  muuka  wiar  aaw-owa}\emphs{]}\emphs{\textsubscript{NP}}\emphs{  sira }\\

\glt
\z

`adoption custom (lit: the custom of getting a son from another family)'

The \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{head noun}} is either a single or a compound noun.  If the head noun is replaced by a pronoun, it can only take post-modifiers (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

\ea%x415
\label{ex:x415}
\gll \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{wi(am)}\emphs{  arow  nain \\
      \\
\glt
\z

A \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{post-modifying noun phrase}} often expresses qualities that in many European languages would be expressed by true adjectives (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or via adjectivalized (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) or comitative expressions (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x416

      \\
\glt
\z

man  wind  long  that1

`the man with good lungs'

A noun phrase can have one or more \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{adjective phrases}} as modifiers. The adjective phrase typically consists of an adjective only. If there are more \textstyleAcronymallcaps{APs} than one, the order is as follows: colour - physical property or human propensity - size/age - value.

\ea%x419
\label{ex:x419}
\gll \emphs{Waa(ya)  muuka } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{kia  gelemuta}\emphs{  op-a-m.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

pig  son  white  small  catch-PA-1s

`I caught  a small white piglet.'

In recorded texts the maximum number of adjective phrases per a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} is two, but the speakers have no difficulty producing \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s with more \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AP}s (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

\ea%x420
\label{ex:x420}
\gll \emphs{Emer(a) } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{itita  enum(a)  eliwa}\emphs{  nain  enak-e.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

sago  soft  new  good  that1  feed.me-IMP.2s

`Give me the good new soft sago/bread to eat.'

The position of either a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{quantifier phrase}} or an \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{indefinite}} is after the adjective phrase.

\ea%x804
\label{ex:x804}
\gll \emphs{Siowa  morena } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{oko}\emphs{  aruf-a-k.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

dog  male  another  hit-PA-3s

`He hit another male dog.'

The last regular post-modifier in a noun phrase is a \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{demonstrative}}. Especially the distal demonstrative \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{nain} `that' is very common, and in many cases it is no more than a marker for given information.

\ea%x805
\label{ex:x805}
\gll \emphs{koora  erepam } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{nain} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

house  four  that1

`the/those four houses' or `the fourth house'

The \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{dative pronoun}} ({\S}3.5.5) is unusual as a modifier. Semantically it belongs to the noun phrase, marking a possessive relationship, but syntactically it still reflects its origin as a [+human] locative adverbial ({\S}4.6.1) of the verb. It is often non-contiguous with the rest of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}, which can be fronted for as a theme  while the dative pronoun needs to stay in its pre-verbal position (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). Other elements that can separate the dative pronoun from the rest of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} are \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{me} `not' (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), and the free adverbs \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{muutiw} `only' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pun} `also'(\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\subsubsection{Coordinate noun phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21681935131865}{}Joining noun phrases into a coordinate noun phrase can be done either by simple juxtaposition or with connectives. Juxtaposition is the default strategy.  In spoken texts the juxtaposed \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP}s are separated by a longer pause, in written texts by a comma.

\ea%x810
\label{ex:x810}

Coordinate compound nouns ({\S}3.2.5) are the result of conjoining by juxtaposition two nouns that very commonly go together. 

The pragmatic connective\emphs{} \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} `additive' ({\S}3.11.1) is used rather infrequently to connect the parts of a coordinate noun phrase. When it is used and there are more than two noun phrases to connect, it is usually placed between the last two noun phrases, but other positions are possible too, see (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

\ea%x812

A focus or case marking clitic is only added to the last noun phrase in a coordinate noun phrase:

\ea%x893
\label{ex:x893}
\gll \emphs{Manin}\emphs{  koora  nain } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{koka  ne  ifara=ke}\emphs{  wakesim-o-k.} \\

3p.GEN  foot  ADD  hand=INST  road  search-PA-1/3p

`They felt (lit: searched) for the road with their feet and hands.'

Also the pragmatic connective \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aria} `alright' can occasionally join the elements of a coordinate noun phrase. As a sentential or clausal connective it indicates a break in the discourse, but when it joins two noun phrases there does not seem to be a significant difference between that and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} `additive'. It may be that \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{aria} draws more attention to the separate noun phrases being joined than either juxtaposition or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ne} does.

\subsubsection{Comitative noun phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21701935131865}{}A comitative noun phrase is made up of one or two basic noun phrases plus a comitative postposition or clitic ({\S}3.12.1). A comitative pronoun ({\S}3.5.9) either by itself or attached to a \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} can also form a comitative phrase (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). When there is only one overt noun phrase and it  is unmarked for number, the plurality is shown both by the comitative marking and in the verb person marking (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). The choice of the comitative marker and the number marking in the verb, when relevant,  reflect whether the noun phrases in the comitative relationship are co-subjects/co-objects of the same verb, or whether one is a dominant member.

\subsection{Adjective phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21741935131865}{}The head of an adjective phrase (\textstyleAcronymallcaps{AP}) is an adjective. Most commonly it occurs alone, but it can be intensified by an intensity adverb either preceding or following it, or both (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).  The negator \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{marew} `none, no' when following the adjective, negates its quality, thus creating its opposite (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

The adjective phrase functions as a post-modifier in a noun phrase (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), or as a non-verbal predicate (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). 

A coordinate adjective phrase is also possible:

\ea%x891

The pragmatic function of adjectives in discourse\footnote{For \textstyleFootnoteBaseChar{the function of adjectives in English and Mandarin Chinese spoken text see \citet{Thompson1988} and \citet{Croft1991}. The former claims the main function is to predicate the property of an established discourse referent; attributive function, or modification, is secondary and used almost exclusively for new participants. But Croft considers modification the main discourse function of the adjectives.  As for Papuan languages, Roberts reports that in Amele the adjective normally functions as a modifying (lit: attributive) element in a NP (1987:319).}} seems to vary according to the language. In Mauwake the modification of a new participant is the main function of adjective phrases.\footnote{In the text data nearly half of the occurrences (48\%) of adjectives were in attributive positions where the adjective modified a \textit{new} participant.} Also a known participant is modified by an adjective especially in cases where the adjective is needed for contrast: \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{manin}\emphs{(}\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{a}\emphs{)} \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{maneka} `big garden' and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{manin}\emphs{(}\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{a}\emphs{)} \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{gelemuta}\textstyleEmphasizedWords{} `small garden', referring to two different \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{types}} of garden (also called \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ekina} and \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{esewa} respectively), were repeated several times in a text describing garden work. 

\subsection{Quantifier phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21761935131865}{}A quantifier phrase usually only consists of a quantifier head (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) ({\S}3.4), but it can be modified by a few intensity adverbs (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) ({\S}3.9.2).

\subsection{Possessive phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21781935131865}{}The possessive phrase\footnote{Not to be confused with the Possessive NP.} is a very specific and rarely occurring structure. It consists of an unmarked or genitive pronoun, followed by the long form of the dative pronoun ({\S}3.5.5), which has developed from the dative pronoun and the the verb \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{ik}{}- `be'. The verb has lost all inflection and only retains the root, which has merged to the dative pronoun. The possessive phrase only functions as a non-verbal predicate. It is always without a head noun; a co-referential noun or pronoun is in an earlier \textstyleAcronymallcaps{NP} in the same clause.

\ea%x847

`My father's possessions, too, are mine.'

\subsection{Verb phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21801935131865}{}There is no justification in Mauwake for a verb phrase as it is understood in the generative sense, as a constituent including almost everything else than the subject of the sentence.\footnote{The verb phrases in the traditional sense of the word, a group of verbs functioning as one unit, are treated under verbal clusters ({\S}3.8.5).}  But there is one structure that can be called a verb phrase: an accusative pronoun plus a verb.  In this structure nothing can come between the two elements, not even a verbal negation, which is usually placed immediately before the verb.

Every transitive verb requires an accusative pronoun for a [+human] object, regardless of whether there is an object noun phrase or not. The accusative pronoun is also required with a plural beneficiary.

\subsection{Adverbial phrases}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21821935131865}{}An adverbial phrase may consist of an adverb word alone or modified by an intensity adverb, a noun phrase plus a clitic or a postposition, or a dative pronoun functioning as a [+human] locative phrase.

The main function of an adverbial phrase is to modify the verb. An \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AdvP} is an optional constituent in a clause, not an obligatory argument. 

The default position of the adverbial phrase depends on the semantic type of the \textstyleAcronymallcaps{AdvP}. Recursion is possible, and is more common in the case of locative and temporal phrases than the others.

\subsubsection{Locative phrases}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21841935131865}{}The number of locative adverbs is small ({\S}3.6.3). Most locative phrases are made up of a noun phrase plus a clitic if they indicate a location, source or path, and of a noun phrase only if they indicate a goal. Giv\'on (1984:78, 110-112) distinguishes between the locative adverbials and the locative objects of certain verbs. The former have the whole clause in their scope, the latter only the verb. While there is this scope difference between the two, in Mauwake they are syntactically similar. 

The locative adverbs ({\S}3.6.3), all of which are deictic, occur by themselves, without modifiers. The same form can be used for location, source, or goal, depending on the verb.

When the locative phrase is based on a noun phrase, one form is used both for  a location where something takes place and a source, but a goal is marked differently.  The phrases indicating a location are formed by adding the locative clitic \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pa}  to a noun phrase:

When the locative phrase is [+human], the dative pronoun ({\S}3.5.5) must be used:

\glt
\z

here.CF  3.DAT  be-SS  again  man  3.DAT  ascend-IMP.2s

`Stay here with him and (then) go (back) to your husband again.'

The dative pronoun is also commonly added when the location is a village or a larger area, which is seen mainly as a setting for the people. In both (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) and (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) above it is the \textstyleEmphasizedWords{\textsc{location}} which is in focus, in the former as the closest village to flee to, and in the latter as an object of bombing, so the dative pronoun is not used. In (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) a certain culturally important place referred to is in the area of the Koran people and considered their property:

\ea%x1801
\label{ex:x1801}
\gll \emphs{Koran  epa=pa } \textstyleEmphasizedVernacularWords{wiar}\emphs{  ik-ua.} \\
      \\
\glt
\z

Koran  place=LOC  3.DAT  be-PA.3s

`It is in Koran area.'

The noun phrase indicating a path is marked with the instrumental clitic -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iw}, or occasionally with the locative clitic -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pa} (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\label{ex:x866}

When a clause has more locative phrases than one, the following rules apply. If  the phrases have a different function, source is placed before goal (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). When they have the same function and a deictic locative adverb strengthens another locative phrase, the adverb follows the other locative (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). But  the dative pronoun, when used locatively, has to be placed even after the locative adverb (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). When both of the phrases have an independent meaning, the phrase indicating the more general location comes first, and the one marking the more specific location follows.

\ea%x868

\subsubsection{Temporal phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21861935131865}{}Temporals mark location in time, so it is natural that temporal phrases behave very similarly to locative phrases.  They can consist of a temporal adverb ({\S}3.9.1.2), possibly modified by an intensity adverb ({\S}3.9.2); or of a noun phrase ({\S}4.1) with a head noun indicating time, plus a locative clitic ({\S}3.12.4).

\ea%x872

      \\
\glt
\z

ADD  Friday=LOC  feast  burst-PA-3s  afternoon

`And on Friday the feast started, in the afternoon.'

Recursion of temporal phrases is possible and quite common.  When there are two or more temporal phrases in the same clause, the order is determined by whether the temporals are deictic and/or specific ({\S}3.9.1.2).  Their default order relative to each other is as follows:

(non-deictic non-specific) {\textgreater} deictic non-specific {\textgreater} deictic specific {\textgreater} TempNP (day) {\textgreater} non-deictic specific {\textgreater} TempNP (time of day) {\textgreater} (non-deictic non-specific)

The position of the non-deictic non-specific temporal is either as the first or the last element of the group of temporals.

\ea%x874

\glt

`We'll talk again later on Wednesday.'

When a noun phrase acts as a temporal phrase, the locative clitic -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pa} is attached to it (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), unless it is followed by another temporal phrase specifying it further or it includes a demonstrative (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}). If there are several of these temporal noun phrases, their relative order is from the larger time unit to the smaller one. 

\ea%x878

\glt
\z

`It will finish in March this year.' 

A temporal phrase may be formed with the instrumental clitic -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iw} ({\S}3.12.5) when something takes place repeatedly at the same time of the day. The example (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}) is here repeated as (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}):

\ea%x1907
\label{ex:x1907}

\subsubsection{Manner phrase}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21881935131865}{}An adverbial phrase indicating manner most often consists of just a manner adverb ({\S}3.9.1.3).  That is occasionally intensified by an intensity adverb ({\S}3.9.2).

A manner phrase can also be formed by a noun phrase plus a clitic, instrumental \nobreakdash-\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iw} or, less frequently, with locative -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pa}.  

\ea%x882

`We have to work according to the custom of our grandfathers.'

If there are more manner phrases than one, one of them is usually deictic \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{naap} `thus, like that' or \textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{feenap} `like this' either preceding or following the other manner phrase(s).

\ea%x883
\label{ex:x883}

One type of a manner phrase is one that indicates instrument.  It is always formed with a noun phrase plus one of three clitics: instrumental -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iw}\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{} ({\S}3.12.5), locative -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{pa}  ({\S}3.12.4)\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{} or comitative -\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{iya}\textstyleStyleVernacularWordsItalic{} ({\S}3.12.1). The instrumental clitic is the most common. 

\ea%x886
\label{ex:x886}

When a coordinate noun phrase is made into an instrumental manner phrase, the instrumental clitic only follows the last noun phrase.

`With their feet and hands they felt (lit: searched) for the road.'

The use of locative clitic is restricted almost exclusively to those cases where the instrument is a vehicle (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}), so they could also be understood as locatives. In other cases it is used rarely (\stepcounter{nx}{\thenx}).

\ea%x887

harvesting.stick=LOC  betelnut  that1  pluck-SS.SEQ  get-PA-1/3p

`They picked the betelnuts with a harvesting stick.'

The comitative clitic is also possible but infrequent in instrumental manner phrases. Its use in this function may be influenced by Tok Pisin, where \textstyleForeignWords{wantaim} `together (with)' is used not only for accompaniment, but for instruments as well.

\ea%x890
